This also made After Hours the first album since Drake's Scorpion in 2018 to have three singles from the same album reach number one. \"Save Your Tears\" spent two weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\n== Background and promotion ==\nOn July 12, 2019, a snippet of the track appeared online, leading many to believe that it was set to appear on After Hours. On March 17, 2020, the music identifying app Shazam revealed that the record would be the eleventh song on the Weeknd's fourth studio album. Later that day, the Weeknd confirmed the piece's presence as the album's track list was released.\n\n\n== Lyrics and composition ==\nAccording to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Group, the record is written in the key of C Major with an Allegro moderato tempo of 118 beats per minute. The Weeknd's vocal range spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of A4.Complex's Joyce Ng summarized the song: \"Its production billows into an array of bright synths and ominous melodies. Lyrically, the Weeknd appears self reflective as he atones for his past. Ultimately, 'Save Your Tears' feels like the narrative arc of what the Weeknd envisioned for his reclusive protagonist all along, now emerging from the darkness but failing to resist temptation\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Save Your Tears\" received universal acclaim. Billboard hailed the song as the best track on After Hours, stating: \"Although 'Save Your Tears' is one of the most pop-driven songs on the album, the Weeknd doesn't hold back when it comes to the rather cold nature he usually finds himself adopting when it comes to his lovers. The production remains upbeat and steady the entire time, thanks to work from Max Martin, Oscar Holter, DaHeala, and The Weeknd himself, combining the best of his old content and some newer, more mainstream-driven sounds\". Craig Jenkins of Vulture raved, \"The Weeknd perfects the kitschy '80s genre experiment with 'Save Your Tears', a gutting breakup tune gorgeous and simple enough to stand alongside peak '80s pop like the Cars' 'You Might Think' (and slick enough to swipe a bit of melody from Wham!'s 'Everything She Wants' in the chorus). The piece concocts sound informed by both trap and dance music, encased in dense atmospherics, and heavy on crisp, bright keys\". \"'Save Your Tears' has both tonal echoes of Depeche Mode's melancholy and a nod to 'Everything She Wants' by Wham!, exhibiting shimmery mid-80s luxuriance\", praised The New York Times editor Jon Caramanica.Slant columnist Seth Wilson observed, \"'Save Your Tears' revels in spite, flaunting how over-it Tesfaye is in front of his ex while teasing the possibility of reconciliation. Tesfaye's distinct brand of R&B consistently draws from other genres, but hearing him embrace a straight-up synth-rock sound here is an exciting change of pace\". \"He draws on synth-pop nostalgia to mirror the tragic glitz of '80s Hollywood: the plinking synths and slick hand-claps of 'Save Your Tears' evokes a long-lost Wham! track. His bleeding-heart melodies and unforgettable hooks remind us why we keep listening to the '80s first place\", exclaimed Pitchfork writer Isabella Herrera. Jem Aswad of Variety commented, \"'Save Your Tears', which could have been an MTV staple in the early '80s, is begging for period-appropriate videos. The record has thwacking electronic percussion and the vocoder hearkening back to Electric Light Orchestra's 'Mr. Blue Sky'\".Mark Richardson from The Wall Street Journal asserted that \"'Save Your Tears' includes soaring melodies that provide ample opportunity for Mr. Tesfaye to show off his vocal range, being used on television singing competitions. By design, it is big and broad, less specific lyrically and further from the shadowy persona at the heart of the Weeknd\u2014Mr. Tesfaye often seems downright affable here. Mr. Martin and the Weeknd show the influence of 1980s synth pop. The piece sounds like something from a John Hughes soundtrack\". Michael Cragg from Vogue UK praised the record as \"the sort of synth experimentation last heard in 1984 on The NeverEnding Story soundtrack\". GQ's Zak Maoui applauded \"Save Your Tears\" as one of the Weeknd's \"best musical offerings to date\". Apple Music applauded the composition, \"Few things about 'Save Your Tears' mark it as a breakup song: For one, the production is drenched in bright, '80s-style synths that sound more glamorous than forlorn. Yet the Weeknd manages to imbue the single with a sense of heartbroken remorse, a rare emotion in his arsenal. Many came to love him through his more shadowy offerings, but there's no denying the power he brings to the nostalgic, splashy pop style he exhibits here\". IFPI Chief Executive, Frances Moore has stated, \"It has been another brilliant year for 'The Weeknd' and 'Save Your Tears' has unquestionably been one of the world\u2019s most loved songs.\"\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nFollowing the release of its parent album, \"Save Your Tears\" debuted at number 41 on the US Billboard Hot 100, dated April 4, 2020.

The process commenced as he shaped a general sculpture of the Weeknd's modified visage, then created the prosthetics. Four primary prosthetic components were involved: one for each lip; one for the nose, eyebrows, and forehead; and one for the cheeks and chin. After they were applied to the Weeknd's face, makeup was utilized to make them blend in.\n\n\n=== Release and synopsis ===\nThe official music video for \"Save Your Tears\" was first teased by the singer as being on its way through his social media platforms on January 4, 2021. It was released the following day.Directed by Cliqua, the video sees the Weeknd wearing a diamond-adorned version of his original red-jacketed outfit. The bruises on his face are no longer present, although his character has apparently undergone a bizarre plastic surgery. He performs in a lavish nightclub occupied by formally attired members wearing glittery, full-face masks that pay homage to scenes from Stanley Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut; his backing band is also wearing masks. He wanders out into the motionless, seated crowd, guzzling one person's champagne and laying his arm on the head of another, until he notices a gorgeously brilliant, maskless woman in the audience (played by Bianca Rojas) and guides her onstage. While they initially are dancing joyfully, the camera soon reveals that the Weeknd is hiding a pistol behind his back. The lights go out and when the lights are turned back on, the Weeknd has placed his gun in one of her hands with him pointing the gun at his own head. The woman realizes this and shrieks. The scene concludes with the Weeknd holding the pistol to his own head. As the song finishes, he pulls the trigger, releasing confetti. The assembly applauds enthusiastically.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nThe music video received widely positive reviews from critics. Rolling Stone journalist Jon Blistein exclaimed, \"The Weeknd delivers an exuberant rendition of 'Save Your Tears' to a lifeless, buttoned-up crowd all wearing party masks\". Variety columnist Jen Aswad stated, \"It's a fitting, more than slightly disturbing and suitably bizarre continuation in a series of highly unconventional promotional videos\". Editor Starr Bowenbank of Cosmopolitan asserted, \"The Weeknd continues to deliver high-quality content\u2026and his newest offering, the music video for 'Save Your Tears' is no exception\".The aforementioned prosthetic led to the formation of memes and saw the Weeknd compared to Handsome Squidward.Hidden symbolism referencing the Grammys and the recent controversial snub that occurred to him at the time of the clip's release, was also notably picked up.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nThe song's debut live performance occurred during the American Music Awards of 2020 on November 22, 2020, where it was performed alongside the Kenny G remix of \"In Your Eyes\" in downtown Los Angeles. In his performance, the Weeknd sported a bandaged look that continued the narrative of the visuals that he released for After Hours.In August 2020, the song was one of the tracks featured on TikTok's virtual concert: The Weeknd Experience. It served as the AR livestream's closing track.On February 7, 2021, \"Save Your Tears\" was performed halfway through Tesfaye's performance at the Super Bowl LV halftime show at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.On May 11, 2021, the Weeknd performed at the Brit Awards. Decked out in a sailor-style raincoat, the Weeknd crooned \"Save Your Tears\" in a brightly lit, sparse box as thunder and lightning raged above him. Toward the end of the song, he wandered out of the box to finish singing in the rain.On May 27, 2021, the Weeknd serenaded the audience with \"Save Your Tears\" remix featuring Grande at the iHeartRadio Music Awards. The musician was dressed in a sleek black suit against a glittery background. Later, Grande appeared in a silky purple gown. She dazzled alongside the Weeknd before adorning the bridge with her whistle notes. The artists concluded in a dual arranged chorus finale.\n\n\n== Remixes ==\n\n\n=== OPN remix ===\nThe record's official remix was created by OPN and is included in the original deluxe edition of After Hours and the remix EP After Hours (Remixes). Salvatore Maicki of The Fader praised the collaboration: \"On the OPN remix of 'Save Your Tears', they meet in the middle, igniting a technicolor spectacle\".\n\n\n=== Ariana Grande remix ===\nThe second remix, a collaboration with American singer Ariana Grande, was released on April 22, 2021, with an accompanying animated music video. The song marks the third collaboration between the Weeknd and Grande, after \"Love Me Harder\" (2014) and \"Off the Table\" (2020).\n\n\n==== Reception ====\nThe second remix garnered universal acclaim. Billboard staff member Katie Atkinson complimented, \"Ariana Grande brings her ethereal vocals to the song\". \"The Weeknd and Ariana Grande's third collaboration will have you smiling all year long\", Billboard journalist Gab Ginsberg exclaimed. Natalia Barr of The Wall Street Journal hailed it as one of the best new pop records, \"the two singers have reunited on an updated piece from the Weeknd's new wave-inspired album from last year, After Hours. Grande adds her sultry vocals to the song's second verse and chorus\". NME columnist Will Lavin noted, \"Grande adds a fresh and husky verse of her own to the remix\".Monica Sisavat from PopSugar described the remix as pure perfection, \"Let's just say their voices together are just chef's kiss.\" \"The pair's vocals intermingle on the wistful, synth-laden track as they harmonize,\" Rolling Stone editor Althea Legaspi stated. Apple Music celebrated the composition, \"'Save Your Tears' is just as dreamy and lush as the 2020 original, but Grande's vocal acrobatics lend it a new dynamic\u2014it's a duet now, two former lovers looking up at the same night sky, talking back and forth at a distance\".The song is featured in the 2021 dance video game Just Dance 2022. The remix also earned six Billboard Music Awards.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Billboard.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Year-end charts ===\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSave Your Tears (Audio) on YouTube\nSave Your Tears (OPN remix audio) on YouTube\nSave Your Tears (Ariana Grande remix audio) on YouTube",

During this time, the two were in the studio working with Nile Rodgers and Guy Lawrence of Disclosure. In an interview with New Zealand radio DJ Zane Lowe for the Apple Music podcast Beats 1, Paak said the song required a lot of \"patience and delicate\". He added, \"A lot of meat went into this song.\" Mars lamented the lack of live performances due to the COVID-19 pandemic, adding \"While I'm writing songs, that's a part of my whole thing...I can't wait till people hear this.\" In late February 2021, Mars and .Paak announced on social media the formation of their new band, Silk Sonic, and revealed the artwork for their debut studio album, titled An Evening with Silk Sonic (2021). They also announced the release of the first single on March 5, 2021. On August 18, 2021, during an interview with Rolling Stone, Mars confessed that the bridge of the song \"almost broke the band up. But it wasn't right, and we all felt it.\" He furthered, \"Andy played this thing, and he knew where the groove had to go, but for some reason I kept screaming, 'Man it sounds like books falling!' I was like, 'We gotta turn it down'.\"On March 5, 2021, \"Leave the Door Open\" was released as the first single via digital download and streaming services in various countries by Aftermath Entertainment and Atlantic Records. On the same date, \"Silk Sonic Intro\" was also issued featuring the album's special guest Bootsy Collins. \"Leave the Door Open\" was released to US contemporary hit radio on March 9, 2021, by Atlantic Records. American Adult contemporary radio stations began adding the track onto their playlists on March 8, 2021, through the aforementioned label. Subsequently, Warner Music Group also issued the track for radio airplay in Italy on March 12, 2021. On April 1, 2021, a live recording of the single was released for digital download and streaming, using audio from the 2021 Annual Grammy Awards performance with added narration from Collins. On the same date, two CD singles, one with the original version, and other with the live version of \"Leave the Door Open\", were released in various countries.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\"Leave the Door Open\" was written by Mars, Brandon Anderson, Dernst Emile II and Christopher Brody Brown. The production was handled by Mars and D' Mile. The former played the guitar and congas, while the latter played the piano. Paak played the drums, with Brown playing the bass. Larry Gold did the arrangement and conduction of the strings at Milk Boy Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with Cody Cichowski recording the strings. Ella Feingold was in charge of guitar effects, Glenn Fischbach played the cello, Jonathan Kim and Yoshihiko Nakano were responsible for the viola, Blake Espy, Emma Kummrow and Gared Crawford played the violin with Natasha Colkett, Tess Varley and Luigi Mazzocchi. Charles Moniz, with engineering assistant Alex Resoagli, engineered and recorded the song at Shampoo Press & Curl Studios. Serban Ghenea mixed \"Leave the Door Open\" at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, with John Hanes serving as the mix engineer and Bryce Bordone as mixing assistant. It was mastered by Randy Merrill at Sterling Sound, NYC. The artwork of the CD single was designed by Virgilio Tzaj.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Leave the Door Open\" is a Philadelphia soul, R&B, and pop song. It is influenced by quiet storm. It has been described as a \"smooth slow jam\". Gil Kaufman from Billboard described it as a \"finger-snapping, slinky R&B jam\". Its instrumentation includes a \"descending guitar glissando\", a glockenspiel, \"swooning strings\", \"honeyed backing vocals\", \"soft piano and smooth vocals\". The song also features key changes, and a contrast between \"grainy lead and perfectionist backup vocals\". The \"ascendant bridge\" was created using various \"chord changes which meld into each other.\" \"Leave the Door Open\" was composed in the key of C major with a tempo of 74 beats per minute. The singers' vocal ranges span from the a low note of F4 to a high note of D6.\"Leave the Door Open\" starts with .Paak's \"raspy\" voice and Mars's background ad-libs. Paak sets the scene: \"We should be dancin', romancin'/ In the east wing and the west wing of this mansion.\" In the chorus, Mars hopes the woman feels the same way he does. Its lyrics are described as a \"detailed erotic invitation\" with \"shameless but witty wordplay\". Mars and Paak sing to a loved one \"to come over for a romantic night with wine, rose petal-laced baths, and more.\" Katie Atkinson from Billboard described its lyrics as \"tongue-in-cheek\". NME's Sophie Williams noticed playful humour on its lyrics. Sowing from Sputnikmusic said, \"Its luscious vocal harmonies are accompanied by an earthy splattering of retro-sounding drums and spacious, almost celestial-reaching, strings.\"Charlie Harding from Vulture said \"Leave the Door Open\" shows the \"1970s Philadelphia soul\" and despite being \"serious musically\", it is \"lighthearted, lyrically.\" Harding commented that despite feeling nostalgic, it \"sounds contemporary\" due to Paak's vocal flow. American singer-songwriter Tayla Parx, who has worked previously with Paak, said its modern sound comes from the \"conversational\" lyrics and Paak's \"personality\" and silliness. Harding commented that its modern approach can be heard at the end of Paak's first verse, to which Parx responded \"You can hear [the early influences] in his voice, but those cadences are still very contemporary\". Harding noticed how Paak made the influences heard on the track his own.Harding commented that Silk Sonic leads the listener into a music journey as they wait for their lover. It begins with a \"non-resolving chord progression, which never lands in the home key but uses luscious chords\" and leaves the listener expecting. Paak is drinking wine and spending time in his mansion, as he waits for his passion. Nevertheless, Mars doesn't allow Paak's fulfillment as he shifts the chords, using a new key. The energy and tension reach new heights as Mars \"sets up this big cadence\", and while the listener is hopping to reach a \"resolution\" it enters the \"non-resolving chord progression\" on the chorus. However, as the latter approaches its end a C major chord is played, Silk Sonic sing \"tell me that you're coming through\" and it enters into its \"resolution\".Various publications compared the track to Mars's \"Versace on the Floor\" (2017). Consequence's staff along with Mary Siroky also found similarities with Mars's \"That's What I Like\" (2017). NME's Anna Rose said \"Leave the Door Open\" was \"reminiscent of 60s and 70s easy listening love songs\". On the same vein, Zoe Haylock from Vulture dubbed the single a \"smooth bedroom classic\" as invokes the \"'70s slow jams\". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times thought Mars's falsetto voice to be close to the Spinners and the Stylistics. Similarly, The New York Times's Jon Pareles compared the \"close-harmony seductions\" to the ones used by the Spinners, the Manhattans and the Stylistics. Variety writer Jem Aswad compared its style to the Delfonics and the Chi-Lites. MTV News's Patrick Hosken affirmed it is a \"throwback to the time of Bobby Womack and Curtis Mayfield\". Sophie Williams from NME compared the use of part of the songs's instrumentation to \"Philadelphia soul groups such as The Delfonics and The O'Jays.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Leave the Door Open\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Jenessa Williams from The Guardian found its style to be \"impeccable\", being \"on the right side of pastiche\". Consequence's Wren Graves was impressed by Mars's \"liquid whip\" voice as Paak \"raps and sings through a foggy haze\", sounding \"like smoke on the water\". The New York Times critic Jon Pareles praised the song's instrumentation, the key changes, lyrics and the contrast between the backup and lead vocals, concluding \"all good things to revive.\" Consequence's staff and Mary Siroky called it \"nothing if not luxurious, velvety goodness.\" Variety writer Jem Aswad called the track \"a glorious blast of vintage R&B\", Aswad concluded, \"the song and the arrangement are pitch-perfect\". Roisin O'Connor from The Independent stated .Paak performs \"Marvin Gaye-style harmonies that glisten like butter on hot toast.\" She also commended the songs composition and some of its lyrics. Sophie Williams from NME described the song as \"sumptuous\", showcasing Mars's \"best vocal performance to date\". Paste's Candace McDuffie lauded the track. McDuffie added, \".Paak's salacious chants are smoothed over by Mars's sultry crooning.\"No Ripcord's Joe Rivers called the track \"outstanding\". Rivers explained, the \"harmonies recall the best moments of The Stylistics while still leaving room for .Paak's taut drum fills.\" Gon\u00e7alo Correia writing for Observador felt the track showed \"sensuality\", with \"honey and emotion and the blink of an eye on the lyrics\".   Ross Scarano commenting on Pitchfork affirmed \"Leave the Door Open\" was one of the highlights of An Evening with Silk Sonic, due to its \"slathering elevated technique\u2014all those key changes\u2014with satisfying molten cheese.\" Alex Suskind of Entertainment Weekly said it is a modern \"take on the Delfonics \u2014 with the style and substance to match.\" Hot Press's writer Pat Carty affirmed if the song \"managed to assume human form, would doubtless sport a tasteful silk shirt and medallion combo.\" Sowing from Sputnikmusic found the track to be \"irrefutably romantic\". Sowing added, \"Mars's earnest delivery of simple gestures like \"I ain't playin' no games, every word that I say is coming straight from the heart\" sounds sincere enough to sweep you off your feet. When creating their list of \"GRAMMY Predictions 2022\",  Meredith B. Kile\u200d & Tionah Lee\u200d called \"Leave the Door Open\" a \"perfectly timeless record.\"AllMusic's critic Andy Kellman said the track \"best meshes the smooth and tender style of Mars with Paak's nephew-of-Bobby Womack rasp\". Josh Glicksman commenting on Billboard \"Five Burning Questions\" article said the track is \"tailor-made to dance and snap along to as it gets delightfully stuck in your head\". Carl Lamarre, on a different segment on Billboard Five Burning Questions, called the vocals \"buttery\" and \"too irresistible to pass up\". Lamarre continued, affirming Silk Sonic \"threaded a polished '70s soundscape from top to bottom\". Writing for the aforementioned publication, Jason Lipshutz, dubbed the single \"an ode to stylish yearning that leans in to the throwback charm.\"On the other hand, Marc Hogan of Pitchfork criticized the track for turning \"'70s soul into a costume drama, without the drama\" and for its \"skillfully rendered pastiche\". Hogan thought it would be the same as listening to \"an expertly curated quiet-storm compilation, like David Toop's 1996 Sugar and Poison.\" He continued its critique dubbing the single a \"shag-carpeted and leisure-suited booty-call slow jam...never breaks character long enough to acknowledge the present.\" Hogan finalized by saying the track is not \"postmodern\", but \"the past in hologram form\".\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nMary Siroky and the Staff from Consequence considered the song the Top Song of the Week on March 6, 2021, saying it \"wouldn't feel out of place on Mars' 2016 24K Magic album \u2014 why mess with a great thing, after all?\" Entertainment Weekly's Eli Enis and Alex Suskind placed \"Leave the Door Open\" among \"the five best songs we heard this week\" on March 5, 2021, with \"all come-ons\" lyrics and \"pitch-perfect harmonies\".

She added, \"neither is going about musical curiosity the wrong way.\" Dave Holmes, in Esquire's \"Best Songs of 2021 (So Far)\" praised \"Leave the Door Open\", calling it a \"flawless tribute to mid-'70s R&B with a key change that will make you stand up and cheer.\" The song was considered the best release until June 2021 by Complex; Jessica McKinney wrote, \"rarely does a new record come along that can bring together all generations, but \"Leave the Door Open\" does exactly that.

Mars continued, saying they would send an audition tape. He finished the letter by saying, \"I hope you'll consider this request and give us the opportunity to shine.\" Silk Sonic were announced as performers on the show after \"playfully campaigning\" the week before. The Recording Academy interim president/CEO, Harvey Mason Jr., confessed their performance was not announced in the full lineup in order to create \"buzz\", but also because there was some uncertainty regarding it. The Grammys' executive producer, Ben Winston, said Mars decided to \"have fun and tease\" regarding the show.

Let's go!\".\" Afterwards the full instrumental kicked in, and along with a featured a minimalist choreography Silk Sonic invited the audience to sing-along to the chorus, matching their harmonies.

Jamie Samhan writing for Entertainment Tonight Canada and Kate Hogan from People found their show \"sexy\". Derrick Rossignol of Uproxx was surprised, saying Silk Sonic is \"a one-trick pony, but what a trick it is\".On June 27, 2021, Silk Sonic performed the single at the BET Awards 2021 for a \"select group of fans\", who were vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus.

The latter also served as backup dancers and \"played VIP clubgoers and bottle service girls.\" At the end of the performance, Paak teased the audience asking, \"Do y'all want to hear a new song? Do ya'll want to hear a new song off the new album?\" and as fans cheered in, he retreated his statement as the song was still in the top 10. He added, that they would never stop playing \"Leave the Door Open\" one until that changes.

Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos affirmed Silk Sonic transformed the 2021 BET Awards \"into a smokey lounge with their velvety performance.\"A day after Silk Sonic performed \"Leave the Door Open\" at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards James Corden parodied \"Leave the Door Open\" on The Late Late Show with James Corden. The song was retitled \"Leave the TV On\", its lyrics \"jokingly asked\" and \"encouraged\" people to let their \"TV set on after Colbert\" in order to \"get some good ratings.\" It started with \"Stephen Colbert, host of CBS' preceding talk show The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, introducing Corden via an analog television set.\" It then proceeded to show Corden and the band, dressed with '70s inspired clothes as they sang on a \"yellow-walled studio\" similar to the set of All in the Family (1971-1979). While the band leader, Reggie Watts sang about \"the late night sandwich meat\", Corden was in charge of the backing vocals and leads vocals as he sang \"counter-lines about his omnipresent man Spanx\". Corden also let people know they can \"leave the TV on mute, or watch the skit later on YouTube.\" Billboard's Gil Kaufman considered it a \"funny spoof\". Darlene Aderoju of People considered \"the skit...catchy\". However, Aderoju affirmed \"Silk Sonic's Grammy performance was unmatched.\"On April 3, 2021, Epic Games announced the release of a new emote for the online video game Fortnite. It features dance moves by Mars, which are played alongside the chorus of \"Leave the Door Open\".

It has also peaked within the top ten in 18 other countries. At the 2021 ARIA Music Awards, the song won the ARIA Award for Best Pop Release, which resulted in Laroi and Bieber both winning the ARIA Award for Best Artist.At the APRA Music Awards of 2022, the song was nominated for Song of the Year.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 20 September 2020, Laroi shared a snippet of the song on an Instagram live stream, followed by a longer snippet in better quality that was previewed on a live stream from Rolling Loud on 29 October 2020. Bieber's contribution to the song was revealed on 31 May 2021. The song leaked in full on a Discord server on 2 June 2021.\"Stay\" marks Laroi's first major single release as a lead artist in 2021 and Bieber's first major single as a lead artist since the release of his second extended play, Freedom, which was released in April 2021. On 3 June 2021, Scooter Braun, who has been Bieber's manager from the start of his career, also became Laroi's manager, until Laroi left and joined Adam Leber at Rebel Management on 27 September 2021.Laroi had the song for about a year before its release. He created the song while spending time with producers Charlie Puth, Omer Fedi, and Blake Slatkin at Slatkin's house. Puth played the melody of the song on the keyboard, but Laroi ended up liking it and wanted to get it in production software Pro Tools to use it to create a song. He felt that \"it was probably the most organic way of making a song I've ever done \u2013 ever\". Laroi thought Bieber \"would sound perfect\", so he then went to the studio that Bieber records at; they finished recording the song, but Bieber was hesitant about whether his vocals sounded good or not.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\n\"Stay\" is a fast-paced pop, pop rap, pop rock, and synth-pop song. It is set in the key of D\u266d major and incorporates piano keys, heavy drums, and \"splattering\" synths. The upward-darting keyboard riff, made on a Roland Juno-60 synthesizer owned by producer Blake Slatkin, serves as the song's spine and eventually becomes the chorus melody. Over a repeated melodic cell, Laroi and Bieber switch between head voice and chest voice on a minor sixth. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described the track as a \"hyper-slick\" hybridization of new wave and pop-punk. Some critics found similarities between it and the music from Bieber's sixth studio album, Justice (2021). Justin Curto from Vulture compared the song's sound to Justice single \"Hold On\" and album tracks \"Die for You\" and \"Somebody\". Stereogum's Chris DeVille characterized it as \"[p]ost-SoundCloud pop-rap as effervescent Justice-style '80s pop\".The \"heartbreak-fueled\" lyrics to \"Stay\" enforce Laroi's toxic behaviour as he sets up a story about a troubled relationship where he is at fault. In the chorus, he sings about his broken promises before begging for his partner to stay with him: \"I do the same thing I told you that I never would / I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could.\" Robert Rowat of CBC Music interpreted the lines as \"an admission of weakness, if not a promise to be better\". Bieber's verse echoes similar sentiments as he belts out lyrics about being unable to live without his loved one: \"When I'm away from you, I miss your touch / You're the reason I believe in love.\" The song reaches its climax as Laroi and Bieber's voices join in the last chorus.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nOn 16 June 2021, Laroi and Bieber hinted at another collaboration. Leading up to its release, the two artists both teased the song multiple times on their respective social media accounts by posting snippets and teasing the lyrics. Laroi also had previously stated on social media that Ron Perry, the label boss of Columbia Records would not release the song, to which Laroi asked his fans to repeatedly spam Ron Perry on Instagram, which would hopefully change his mind into releasing it. Laroi posted a picture of him at a basketball game on Instagram on 27 June 2021, holding a piece of paper that wrote the song title and the then-questionable release date, to which American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth, who is one of the producers of the song teased his involvement of the song by commenting \"Yessssssssss\". Three days later, Laroi shared a pre-order link in order to reveal the cover art, which would be posted the following day.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting for The New York Times, Jon Caramanica found \"Stay\" to be \"[b]racingly effective\", considering it a more effective pairing of Laroi and Bieber than their previous collaboration on \"Unstable\" from the latter's sixth studio album, Justice. Tyler Jenke from Rolling Stone Australia wrote that \"the slick new tune\" is \"undoubtedly one that lives up [to] the hype\". Jordan Rose of Complex believed that the track has Laroi and Bieber \"leaning into their strengths\". Alex Zidel from HotNewHipHop felt that the song is \"every bit as infectious as [one] would expect\" and thought of it to be \"a solid pop offering for the summer\". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard opined that the song \"sounds like it should push [Laroi] to a new level\" of stardom. Uproxx contributing writer Carolyn Droke stated that the \"buoyant track['s]\" combination of \"a euphoric chorus and a driving beat\" will make it \"the next song of the summer\". Robert Rowat of CBC Music commended Laroi and Bieber's partnership as \"one of the year's best surprises\" and said that the song \"capitalizes on both singers' skills as falsettists\". Chris DeVille from Stereogum described the song as \"maniacally catchy\" and thought it musically feels like Laroi \"blasting off into a new frontier of crossover success\". Vulture's Justin Curto called the track \"a high-energy, synth-filled pop banger\". However, he later criticized the song for being \"some of Laroi's most anonymous work yet\" and concluded that \"it could just as easily be a hit for the Weeknd or Post Malone\".\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Stay\" debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart for the week of 19 July 2021. It became Laroi's second number-one single in Australia after \"Without You\" topped the chart for a week in May and Bieber's fifth as a lead artist. It held on to its position for 14 consecutive weeks, becoming the longest-running number-one single of 2021. In January 2022, the song returned to the number one spot following the 2021 Triple J Hottest 100's announcement and remained there for three additional weeks. Its 17-week reign became the longest run at the top of the ARIA Singles Chart by a male artist(s) and the second-longest overall.In New Zealand, \"Stay\" entered at the top of the New Zealand Singles Chart, securing Laroi's first number-one single in the country and Bieber's 11th overall. The song spent more weeks at number one than any other by an Australian male, maintaining that position for 11 non-consecutive weeks.In the United Kingdom, \"Stay\" entered at number five on the UK Singles Chart on 16 July 2021 \u2013 for the week ending dated 22 July 2021 \u2013 making it Laroi's second top ten hit in Britain and Bieber's 27th. It rose three places to number two a week later, behind Ed Sheeran's \"Bad Habits\" during its fourth week at the summit. It stayed at number two for six weeks and became Laroi's joint-highest-charting song in the UK along with \"Without You\".In Ireland, \"Stay\" entered at number three on the Irish Singles Chart as the week's highest new entry.

            "\"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" is a song by American rapper and singer Lil Nas X. First previewed in a Super Bowl LV commercial in February 2021, the song was released on March 26, 2021, through Columbia Records.

The song and video were praised by some commentators for their boldly queer sensibilities, but were also the subject of backlash from a number of conservative figures in the United States who deemed the content immoral or harmful to children.\n\"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" debuted at the top the Billboard Hot 100, giving Lil Nas X his second number-one hit on the chart after \"Old Town Road\". It was certified platinum in the United States by the RIAA on April 22, 2021. Outside of the United States, \"Montero (Call Me By Your Name)\" topped the charts 20 other countries including Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. The song received nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Music Video at the 2022 Grammy Awards.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2019, Lil Nas X released \"Old Town Road\", a single that would go on to set a record for the longest-charting number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100. However, with some people dismissing his success as a one-hit wonder, Lil Nas X wanted to depart from the country trap sound of \"Old Town Road\" when working on his debut album; instead, he focused on rap, pop, and R&B, influenced by Drake and Nicki Minaj. Take a Daytrip, who produced the song, described the process behind creating the song as serendipitous. In early 2020, Lil Nas X asked the production duo to executively produce his debut album, and started recording ideas on his phone during COVID-19 lockdown. In a recording session, Lil Nas X came up with the lyrics \"Call me when you want, call me when you need, call me in the morning\", which led to producer Omer Fedi recording a guitar part, which was then done on banjo.Originally titled \"Call Me by Your Name\", Lil Nas X played a snippet of the song in a Twitter video on July 9, 2020, as well as in the background of various TikTok videos, including one that was addressed to hip-hop rapper 6ix9ine. It was featured in a Logitech commercial that aired during Super Bowl LV in February 2021. On March 9, 2021, its release date was announced via Twitter, along with its cover. The single cover was created by Spanish\u2013Croatian artist Filip \u0106usti\u0107 and features Lil Nas X as both Adam and God in a reinterpretation of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam.\n\nThe song's title is taken from Lil Nas X's first name, while the subtitle is a reference to the 2017 LGBT romance-themed film of the same name. Andr\u00e9 Aciman, author of the novel from which the film was adapted, expressed that he was grateful and humbled that Lil Nas X had written a song with the same name as his novel. Lil Nas X later stated the film was one of the first queer movies he had ever seen that felt \"very artsy\" and made him interested in the concept of \"calling somebody by your own name as lovers and trying to keep it between you two\", inspiring him to write about it.In an interview with Zane Lowe on the day before the release, he described his new-found self-confidence after being able to express himself freely in his new song. Furthermore, in the May issue of GQ Style, he described the conflict between his sexuality and his Christian upbringing, notably his father's role as a gospel singer, calling the new song and video \"rebellious\" because they allowed him to express himself in a way he hadn't before. On the day of the single's release, Lil Nas X shared an open letter to his 14-year-old self on Twitter, reflecting on his choice to come out at an early age and his nervousness about the song. However, he ultimately says it \"will open doors for many other queer people to simply exist\" and expressed his desire to let people be who they are.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" is a hip hop and electropop song with guitar and handclaps in syncopation. Billboard described the track as a \"flamenco-like track with a subtle trap beat\", while Consequence of Sound called it \"flamenco and reggaeton dipped in pop\". Slate noted the song's \"dembow-style rhythm\" while the chorus was compared to technopop in the style of Gary Numan. Lil Nas X's vocals in the second verse were likened to a cross between Juice Wrld and Iann Dior. The humming section following the chorus was included as a sort of mating call. A longer version of the song, dubbed \"Satan's extended version\", adds an extra half-minute and features an additional iteration of the chorus as well as a longer outro.The song is played alla breve at 90 beats per minute and was originally published in G\u266f minor, with a vocal range from G\u266f3 to G\u266f5. Like previous songs by production duo Take a Daytrip, \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" is in the Phrygian mode and was described as having a \"Middle Eastern or Moorish or Spanish sound\". Its chord progression, D\u266f\u2013E\u2013E\u2013D\u266f, goes up and down a minor second, which was intended to create and release tension. Guitarist Omer Fedi plays the banjo on a harmonic minor scale, which was later processed with reverb and Auto-Tune.The song, like many of Lil Nas X's past projects, features queer themes. Renting out an Airbnb at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to work on his debut album, Lil Nas X revealed that it was written about a man he met in mid-2020, who was partying and taking drugs while in quarantine. In its lyrics, Lil Nas X tells his lover he no longer wants to be on the down-low. He features the line \"shoot a child in yo' mouth while I'm ridin'\", which was intended to help break the stigma around references to gay sexual practices in music. Lil Nas X revealed he was afraid of turning away straight fans with an explicit lyric about gay sex, but decided \"if they feel offended, they were never really here for me.\" The lyrics also discuss the pressure Lil Nas X feels in representing the LGBT community (\"A sign of the times every time that I speak\") and include a reference to the 19 weeks his single \"Old Town Road\" spent atop the Billboard Hot 100 (\"A dime and a nine / It was mine every week\").\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe original track and music video were released on March 26, 2021, with an extended version released on March 29. In addition, Lil Nas X released a number of follow-up videos via his YouTube channel, including a muffled version (titled \"MONTERO but ur in the bathroom of hell while lil nas is giving satan a lap dance in the other room\") on March 28, an instrumental version (subtitled \"But Lil Nas X Is Silent The Entire Time\") on March 31, a behind-the-scenes look behind the song's recording process (subtitled \"Official Video except its not the official video at all\") on April 5, and a lo-fi version (subtitled \"but it's lofi and something you can study to lol\") on April 9. The lo-fi version was produced by L. Dre and Zeuz Makes Music, and was previously uploaded to the latter's YouTube channel a few days earlier. On April 23, he released an a cappella version along with an accompanying music video in the style of The Brady Bunch.Following the song's release, he launched a promotion on Twitter where he gave out $100,000 worth of Bitcoin. He also offered $10,000 through a pole dancing challenge on the social media platform TikTok, with the hashtag #PoleDanceToHell. Another promotional tool was a collaboration with augmented reality mobile app Jadu, in which users can interact with a volumetric video-generated Lil Nas X wearing red angel wings. In addition, a free browser game titled Twerk Hero was released, in which the player controls a virtual Lil Nas X twerking to \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\". Developed by Roni Games using the Unreal Engine, the rhythm game has four levels, each accompanying a scene from the song's music video, and was noted for its jiggle physics. Lil Nas X also unveiled several T-shirts in collaboration with Pizzaslime.On April 13, it was reported that the song was briefly removed from streaming services for unknown reasons, after Lil Nas X had asked his fans to stream the song \"because it may no longer be available tomorrow\". Columbia Records released a statement that the situation was \"out of their control\", but did not elaborate. However, later the same day, Billboard reported that the song was not being removed from streaming services, though no further explanation was offered.\n\n\n=== Satan Shoes ===\n\nTying into the music video's theme, Lil Nas X collaborated with art collective MSCHF Product Studio to create 666 individually numbered pairs of Nike Air Max 97 \"Satan Shoes\" adorned with pentagrams, inverted crosses, and the Bible verse Luke 10:18. They also contain 66 cc (4.0 cu in) of ink mixed with one drop of blood from a member of the MSCHF team in the sole, which was collected over the course of a week. The shoes, which were priced at $1,018 per pair and sold out in under a minute, were compared to comic books by rock band Kiss and Marvel Comics that were printed using the band members' blood. Nike, Inc. was not involved with the design or release of the shoes, and later filed a lawsuit against MSCHF for trademark infringement and dilution. In defense, MSCHF claimed that the shoes were meant to be a form of art for display and not to actually be worn. A U.S. District Court in New York approved of a temporary restraining order against MSCHF, thereby preventing further sales of the shoes, though they were already shipped to their buyers. The lawsuit was eventually settled, with MSCHF issuing a voluntary product recall and buying back any Satan Shoes at their original price.\n\n\n=== Live performances ===\nLil Nas X performed the song as the musical guest on the last episode of season 46 of Saturday Night Live. Airing May 22, 2021, and hosted by actress Anya Taylor-Joy, the episode also featured the performance of his newest song \"Sun Goes Down\". During the performance of \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\", a wardrobe malfunction occurred, splitting the seam of his trousers when he squatted during a pole dance routine, leaving him unable to perform it as planned. Lil Nas X also performed the song at the 2021 BET Awards on June 27, 2021. The ancient Egypt-themed performance was a tribute to the visuals of \"Remember the Time\" by Michael Jackson and ended with the singer kissing a male backup dancer. Billboard ranked the performance number-one out of the sixteen in the ceremony, noting it was \"the highlight of the night\". Madonna compared the performance with her 2003 MTV Video Music Awards performance, when she kissed Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears on stage while performing \"Hollywood\", by sharing the photos of both kisses one above the other on her Instagram stories and captioning it with \"#DidItFirst\". Fans immediately perceived the post as an insult and began to call the singer out; however, Lil Nas X dismissed the post as a joke and stated he's friends with Madonna.\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\n\n=== Production ===\n\nThe music video for \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" was directed by Ukrainian music video director Tanu Muino and Lil Nas X and was released along with the single. Shot over two days in February 2021, it features Lil Nas X as various characters in biblical and mythology-inspired scenes. While in Los Angeles, Muino expressed her interest in working with Lil Nas X to Columbia Records; the label contacted her in late January 2021 while she was working on the music video for Cardi B's \"Up\". She spent two weeks on pre-production with her collaborators before shooting with Lil Nas X. Muino drew inspiration from Dante's Inferno and paintings by Hieronymus Bosch, including The Garden of Earthly Delights\u2014a triptych depicting heavenly and hellish imagery and the Last Judgment. It was Muino's first video as co-director, part of which was done remotely via Zoom after she had falsely tested positive for COVID-19. Anthony H. Nguyen was responsible for the make-up in the video while the hairstyling was done by Evanie Frausto. Visual effects for the music video were done by Mathematic, a French animation studio based in Paris, in a process that took seven weeks. They opted for a video game-inspired look in order to spread a \"message of tolerance\".In an interview with Time, Lil Nas X revealed that inspiration for the video came from the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants and the film Call Me by Your Name. He also discussed the music video for \"Cellophane\" by FKA Twigs as an influence, stating, \"I wanted to see some things people have done in music videos with the pole\u2014and I felt like Twigs did a really amazing job at that... I wanted to do my own take on it.\" Vulture reported that this was an homage to honor Twigs following her loss to Lil Nas X in the Grammy Award for Best Music Video category. However, \"Cellophane\" director Andrew Thomas Huang posted a comparison of the two videos' visual similarities on Instagram, explaining that Lil Nas X's label had contacted him prior to the recording of the video to possibly direct it and had instead hired the same choreographer. He further elaborated, \"When someone who is commercially successful makes work that lives so similarly next to ours and profits from it on such a massive scale, then I felt like I had to speak up\", but said he blamed record labels rather than Lil Nas X. FKA Twigs and Lil Nas X later had a conversation regarding the comparison and praised each other's videos on Instagram.\n\n\n=== Synopsis ===\n\nFollowing a voice-over introduction where Lil Nas X discusses not having to hide in shame, the music video begins with the singer portraying both Adam and the snake in the Garden of Eden. The snake seduces Adam using its third eye, and the two kiss. The next scene features Lil Nas X in chains at the Colosseum as he is judged by versions of himself in Marie Antoinette wigs and stoned by spectators. After he is killed by a thrown butt plug, he starts to ascend toward an angelic figure in Heaven before grabbing onto a pole, which sends him down to Hell as he pole dances. He makes his way over to Satan and proceeds to give him a lap dance wearing Calvin Klein underwear and thigh-high boots with stiletto heels. After snapping Satan's neck, Lil Nas X crowns himself with the horns as his eyes glow and wings emerge.In addition to its biblical references and symbolism, the music video features a running theme of duality, including good vs. evil and masculinity vs. femininity. A Greek quotation from Plato's Symposium is shown on the tree of life: \"After the division the two parts of man, each desiring his other half\". The scene in the Colosseum was seen as a reference to the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate, while the judges' costumes were inspired by the all-denim outfits worn by Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake in 2001. The Latin phrase \"Damnant quod non intelligunt\" is written on the ground below Satan, which translates to \"they condemn what they do not understand\". According to a press release accompanying the video, the final scene represents \"dismantling the throne of judgement and punishment that has kept many of us from embracing our true selves out of fear.\"An analysis of the music video's symbolism by historians compared the snake figure to Lilith from Jewish mythology, who has often been depicted as a serpentine demon. The stoning scene saw Lil Nas X represented as a Christian martyr and the angelic figure was seen to represent Ganymede from Greek mythology, who is widely regarded as a symbol of homosexuality. The video also drew comparisons with the character HIM from the animated series The Powerpuff Girls, for portraying the devil as a \"queer-coded\" entity or a \"red, gay man\", a trope that became prominent in cartoons from the 1990s. Rebecca Long wrote for Observer: \"Intentionally or not, Lil Nas X draws on this history in 'Montero', reclaiming the motif and continuing a long tradition of queer blasphemy\".\n\n\n== Reception and controversy ==\n\nThe song and music video received praise from several outlets for being \"unabashedly queer\". Variety's Adam B. Vary wrote that the video \"changed everything for queer music artists\", noting that some LGBT artists like Jonathan Knight of New Kids on the Block and Lance Bass of NSYNC sang about women while staying closeted, while others like Elton John and Ricky Martin did not explicitly sing about their sexuality. He described the sexual imagery, including the pole dance, as evoking images of Madonna or Janet Jackson, without the need to hide his homosexuality. He also remarked that artists like Frank Ocean and Troye Sivan were bolder about their sexuality, but had never reached the same level of commercial success as Lil Nas X. David Harris, a magister of the Church of Satan, approved of the music video's portrayal of consensual sexuality as well as the ending of Lil Nas X crowning himself Satan.The music video received criticism from conservative commentators in the United States, some of whom deemed it immoral or harmful to children. Governor of South Dakota Kristi Noem, conservative pundit Candace Owens, and evangelical pastor Mark Burns all reacted negatively on Twitter, as did rapper Joyner Lucas and athletes Nick Young and Trevor Lawrence. In response to criticism, Lil Nas X wrote on Twitter: \"There is a mass shooting every week that our government does nothing to stop. Me sliding down a CGI pole isn't what's destroying society\" and \"I am an adult. I am not gonna spend my entire career trying to cater to your children. That is your job\", among other retorts. However, he also confessed that the backlash was \"putting an emotional toll\" on him.The negative reception to the song and music video was characterized by Los Angeles Times and Vice as illustrating a Satanic panic and compared to past moments in popular music history, including jazz music being referred to as \"the devil's music\" in the early 20th century, John Lennon's comment in a 1966 interview that the Beatles were \"more popular than Jesus\", backmasking accusations, the Parents Music Resource Center's \"Filthy Fifteen\", Madonna's music video for \"Like a Prayer\", Lady Gaga's music videos for \"Judas\" and \"Alejandro\", and Nicki Minaj's performance of \"Roman Holiday\" at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards. Esquire referred to it as \"beelzepop\" and similarly compared reception to Gaga's \"Judas\" and Minaj's \"Roman Holiday\".The controversy has been described as being part of the marketing strategy for the song. Neena Rouhani of Billboard depicted the social media outrage as his \"greatest marketing tool\", and Kevin Meenan, a music charts manager at YouTube, described it as \"very explicit\", and that controversy was his goal. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times compared the controversy to bait, and a performance of moral panic, noting how he uses Twitter as a \"performance space [...] with an almost limitless audience\".The visuals of the music video became popular on social media, with the pole dance becoming a meme on TikTok. Additionally, the music video and its reception were lampooned on a Saturday Night Live cold open, with Chris Redd as Lil Nas X discussing the controversy with Chloe Fineman as Britney Spears. In June 2021, a 36 ft \u00d7 36 ft (11 m \u00d7 11 m) mural depicting three of Lil Nas X's looks in the music video was put up in Philadelphia's Gayborhood.\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" debuted at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 for the week of April 10, 2021, with 21,000 downloads, 46.9 million streams, and 1.1 million radio airplay audience impressions. It also debuted at number one on Billboard's Streaming Songs chart and the US Rolling Stone Top 100, and at number two on the Billboard Digital Song Sales chart. The song reached number one on the latter chart during its third week, selling 19,500 downloads and rising from number 3 to become his second leader after his 2019 hit \"Old Town Road\" solo or featuring Billy Ray Cyrus.In the United Kingdom, \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" was the most-streamed song during its week of release, with 6.8 million plays (including 2.5 million video streams), and debuted at the top of the UK Singles Chart on April 2, 2021 \u2013 for the week ending date April 8, 2021 \u2013 becoming Lil Nas X's second number one song in Britain following \"Old Town Road\" in April 2019.

The song spent five weeks atop the chart.In Ireland, the song also debuted at the top of the Irish Singles Chart on April 2, 2021 \u2013 for the week ending date April 8, 2021 \u2013 becoming Lil Nas X's second number one song in the Irish Republic following \"Old Town Road\" in April 2019. The following week, it stayed atop the chart and was the most-streamed song in the country that week.In Australia, the song debuted at number 16 on the ARIA Singles Chart as the highest debut of the week and soared to number 3 the following week becoming his second top ten hit on the chart.

The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2007 and was named the 2008 European Capital of Culture, which it shared with the Norwegian city of Stavanger, and its status as the European Capital of Culture has been credited with kickstarting its economic renaissance.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name comes from the Old English lifer, meaning thick or muddy water, and p\u014dl, meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as Liuerpul. According to the Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names, \"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\". The place appearing as Leyrpole, in a legal record of 1418, may also refer to Liverpool. Other origins of the name have been suggested, including \"elverpool\", a reference to the large number of eels in the Mersey. The adjective \"Liverpudlian\" was first recorded in 1833.Although the Old English origin of the name Liverpool is beyond dispute, claims are sometimes made that the name Liverpool is of Welsh origin, but these are without foundation. The Welsh name for Liverpool is Lerpwl, from a former English local form Leerpool. This is a reduction of the form \u201cLeverpool\u201d with the loss of the intervocalic [v] (seen in other English names and words e.g. Daventry (Northamptonshire) > Danetry, never-do-well > ne\u2019er-do-well).\nIn the nineteenth century, some Welsh publications used the name \u201cLle\u2019r Pwll\u201d (\u201c(the) place (of) the pool\u201d), a reinterpretation of Lerpwl, probably in the belief that \u201cLle\u2019r Pwll\u201d was the original form.\nAnother name, which is widely known even today, is Llynlleifiad, again a nineteenth-century coining. \u201cLlyn\u201d is pool, but \u201clleifiad\u201d has no obvious meaning.  Professor G. Melville Richards (1910\u20101973), a pioneer of scientific toponymy in Wales, in \u201cPlace Names of North Wales\u201d, does not attempt to explain it beyond noting that \u201clleifiad\u201d is used as a Welsh equivalent of \u201cLiver\u201d.\nA derivative form of a learned borrowing into Welsh (*llaf) of Latin l\u0101ma (slough, bog, fen) to give \u201clleifiad\u201d is possible, but unproven.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nKing John's letters patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool. By the middle of the 16th century, the population was still around 500. The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter, making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in an H shape: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street).\nIn the 17th century there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for control of the town were waged during the English Civil War, including an eighteen-day siege in 1644. In 1699, the same year as its first recorded slave ship, Liverpool Merchant, set sail for Africa, Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament, although arguably the legislation of 1695 that reformed the Liverpool council was of more significance to its subsequent development. Since Roman times, the nearby city of Chester on the River Dee had been the region's principal port on the Irish Sea. However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring River Mersey.\nAs trade from the West Indies, including sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715. Substantial profits from the slave trade and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone, William Roscoe and Edward Rushton, were at the forefront of the local abolitionist movement.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nBy the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine.\n\nIn her poem \"Liverpool\" (1832), which celebrates the city's worldwide commerce, Letitia Elizabeth Landon refers specifically to the Macgregor Laird expedition to the Niger River, at that time in progress.Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the Deep South of the United States, which fed the textile industry in the country. Given the crucial place cotton held in the city's economy, during the American Civil War Liverpool was, in the words of historian Sven Beckert, \"the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\"\n\nFor periods during the 19th century, the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London, and Liverpool's Custom House was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer. Liverpool was the only British city ever to have its own Whitehall office.In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city.\n\nAs early as 1851 the city was described as \"the New York of Europe\". During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was attracting immigrants from across Europe. This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool, Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe postwar period after the Great War was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to integrate veterans into the economy. Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including police strikes in London among the Metropolitan Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the UK, settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919 they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in Cardiff, Newport and Barry, and there had been incidents in Glasgow, South Shields, London, Hull and Salford.\n\nThe Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of families were relocated from the inner-city to new suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though this is largely subjective. Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the Great Depression of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city.\nLiverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial airport, operating from 1930. During the Second World War, the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler and Churchill. The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a blitz second only to London's. The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.The Luftwaffe made 80 air raids on Merseyside, killing 2,500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock, the largest dock project in Britain. Much of the immediate reconstruction of the city centre has been deeply unpopular. It was as flawed as much subsequent town planning renewal in the 1950s and 1960s. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. Since 1952 Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne, Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war.\nA significant West Indian black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area.  More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as Toxteth, where housing was less expensive. The black population of Liverpool was recorded at 1.90% in 2011.The construction of suburban public housing expanded after the Second World War. Some of the older inner-city areas were redeveloped for new homes.\nIn the 1960s Liverpool was the centre of the \"Merseybeat\" sound, which became synonymous with the Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also in turn strongly affected American music for years and were internationally popular. The Beatles became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed for years together; they were the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history. Their co-founder, singer, and composer John Lennon was killed in New York City in 1980. Liverpool airport was renamed after him in 2002, the first British airport to be named in honour of an individual.Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool in 1974 became a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside.\nFrom the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of containerisation meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were thrown out of jobs. By the early 1980s unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK, standing at 17% by January 1982. This was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression 50 years previously.In the later 20th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. Since the mid-1990s the city has enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average.\n\n At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process that continues today.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTo celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised a competition to choose county flowers; the sea-holly was Liverpool's final choice.\nCapitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as the Beatles, as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism has also become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy.\nIn 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project, a \u00a3920 m development based on Paradise Street. This produced the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed 'Liverpool ONE,' the centre opened in May 2008.\nIn 2007, the city celebrated the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool, for which a number of events were planned. Liverpool was designated as a joint European Capital of Culture for 2008. The main celebrations, in September 2008, included the erection of La Princesse, a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, and represents the \"eight legs\" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture. La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel.\nSpearheaded by the multi-billion-pound Liverpool ONE development, regeneration has continued through to the start of the early 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects include new buildings in the Commercial District, the King's Dock, Mann Island, the Lime Street Gateway, the Baltic Triangle, the RopeWalks, and the Edge Lane Gateway. All projects could be eclipsed by the Liverpool Waters scheme, which if built will cost in the region of \u00a35.5billion and be one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history. Liverpool Waters is a mixed-use development planned to contain one of Europe's largest skyscraper clusters. The project received outline planning permission in 2012, despite fierce opposition from such groups as UNESCO, which claimed that it would adversely affect Liverpool's World Heritage status.\nIn June 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron launched the International Festival for Business in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014, and the largest in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951. In July 2021, Liverpool lost its World Heritage status, UNESCO citing the Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium and Liverpool Waters projects as not being in keeping with a World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Inventions and innovations ===\n\nLiverpool has been a centre of invention and innovation. Railways, transatlantic steamships, municipal trams, and electric trains were all pioneered in Liverpool as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836, the first railway tunnels in the world were constructed under Liverpool (Wapping Tunnel). From 1950 to 1951, the world's first scheduled passenger helicopter service ran between Liverpool and Cardiff.The first School for the Blind, Mechanics' Institute, High School for Girls, council house, and Juvenile Court were all founded in Liverpool. Charities such as the RSPCA, NSPCC, Age Concern, Relate, and Citizen's Advice Bureau all evolved from work in the city.\nThe first lifeboat station, public bath and wash-house, sanitary act, medical officer for health (William Henry Duncan), district nurse, slum clearance, purpose-built ambulance, X-ray medical diagnosis, school of tropical medicine (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine), motorised municipal fire-engine, free school meal, cancer research centre, and zoonosis research centre all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to Ronald Ross, professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the world. Orthopaedic surgery was pioneered in Liverpool by Hugh Owen Thomas, and modern medical anaesthetics by Thomas Cecil Gray.\nThe world's first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by James Newlands, appointed in 1847 as the UK's first borough engineer. Liverpool also founded the UK's first Underwriters' Association and the first Institute of Accountants. The Western world's first financial derivatives (cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 1700s.In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first lending library (The Lyceum), athenaeum society (Liverpool Athenaeum), arts centre (Bluecoat Chambers), and public art conservation centre (National Conservation Centre). It is also home to the UK's oldest surviving classical orchestra (Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra) and repertory theatre (Liverpool Playhouse).\n\nIn 1864, Peter Ellis built the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, Oriel Chambers, which was a prototype of the skyscraper. The UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey. It was the largest store in the world at the time.Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John Hulley and Charles Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook. The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics. In 1865, Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter.\nSir Alfred Lewis Jones, a shipowner, introduced bananas to the UK via Liverpool's docks in 1884. The Mersey Railway, opened in 1886, incorporated the world's first tunnel under a tidal estuary and the world's first deep-level underground stations (Liverpool James Street railway station).\nIn 1889, borough engineer John Alexander Brodie invented the football goal net. He also was a pioneer in the use of pre-fabricated housing and oversaw the construction of the UK's first ring road (A5058) and intercity highway (East Lancashire Road), as well as the Queensway Tunnel linking Liverpool and Birkenhead. Described as \"the eighth wonder of the world\" at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world for 24 years.\nIn 1897, the Lumi\u00e8re brothers filmed Liverpool, including what is believed to be the world's first tracking shot, taken from the Liverpool Overhead Railway, the world's first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use electric multiple units, employ automatic signalling, and install an escalator.\nLiverpool inventor Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture, producing three of the most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways, and Dinky Toys. The British Interplanetary Society, founded in Liverpool in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world's oldest existing organisation devoted to the promotion of spaceflight. Its journal, the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, is the longest-running astronautical publication in the world.In 1999, Liverpool was the first city outside London to be awarded blue plaques by English Heritage in recognition of the \"significant contribution made by its sons and daughters in all walks of life\".\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nFor the purposes of local government, the city of Liverpool is classified as a metropolitan borough. The metropolitan borough is located within both the county of Merseyside and the Liverpool City Region. Each of these geographical areas is treated as an administrative area with different levels of local governance applying to each.\nLiverpool City Council is the governing body solely for the city of Liverpool and performs functions that are standard of an English Unitary Authority. \nThe Liverpool City Region Combined Authority reserves major strategic powers over such things as transport, economic development and regeneration for the city along with the 5 surrounding boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Combined Authority has competency over areas which have been devolved by national government and are specific to the local area.Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions to local governance apart from these two structures. Liverpool was administered by Merseyside County Council between 1974 to 1986 and some residual aspects of organisation which date back to this time have survived. When the County Council was disbanded in 1986, most civic functions were transferred to Liverpool City Council. However, several authorities such as the police and fire and rescue service, continue to be run at a county-wide level. The county of Merseyside, therefore, continues to exist as an administrative area for a few limited services only, while the capability and capacity of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is evolving over time.The city also elects four members of Parliament (MPs) to the Westminster Parliament.\n\n\n=== Three Mayors ===\nThe City of Liverpool is governed by three separate Mayors each with their own distinct functions and powers.\n\n\n==== Directly Elected Mayor of Liverpool ====\n\nThe Mayor of Liverpool is directly elected by the public every four years to lead Liverpool City Council. The figure is responsible for directing the City Council's policies and appoints cabinet members to run key council functions such as education and housing. The council's 90 elected councillors who represent local communities throughout the city, are responsible for scrutinising the mayor's decisions, setting the budget, and policy framework of the city. The Mayor's responsibility is to be a powerful voice for the city both nationally and internationally, to lead, build investor confidence, and to direct resources to economic priorities. The Mayor also exchanges direct dialogue with government ministers and the Prime Minister through his seat at the Cabinet of Mayors. Discussions include pressing decision-makers in the government on local issues as well as building relationships with the other directly elected mayors in England and Wales. The current Mayor is Joanne Anderson.\n\n\n==== Lord Mayor of Liverpool ====\nThis role is the oldest of the three mayors and is mostly ceremonial. The Lord Mayor is chosen only by councillors within Liverpool City Council, not the general public, and serves a one year term. The Lord Mayor is styled as the 'first citizen' and chosen representative of the city. They represent the city at functions, promote it to the wider world and attend religious ceremonies. They also have the key task of chairing full council meetings and can choose a number of charities to support throughout their term.\n\n\n==== Metro Mayor of Liverpool City Region ====\nThe City of Liverpool is one of the six constituent local government districts of the Liverpool City Region. The Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region is directly every four years by residents of those six boroughs and oversees the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.\nThe Combined Authority is the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and is tasked with taking major strategic decisions on issues such as transport and investment, economic development, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. The current Metro Mayor is Steve Rotheram.\n\n\n=== City Council and MPs ===\n\n\n==== Liverpool City Council Elections ====\nFor local elections the city is split into 30 local council wards, which in alphabetical order are:\n\nDuring the local elections held in May 2011, the Labour Party consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from regaining power for the first time in 12 years, during the previous elections in May 2010. The Labour Party gained 11 seats during the election, taking their total to 62 seats, compared with the 22 held by the Liberal Democrats. Of the remaining seats, the Liberal Party won three and the Green Party claimed two. The Conservative Party, one of the three major political parties in the UK had no representation on Liverpool City Council.In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was reported to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one-star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a \u00a320m shortfall on Capital of Culture funding.While Liverpool through most of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a municipal stronghold of Toryism, support for the Conservative Party recently has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist economic policies of prime minister Margaret Thatcher after her 1979 general election victory contributed to high unemployment in the city which did not begin to fall for many years. Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however the city has seen hard times under Labour governments as well, particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom but also suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied.\n\n\n==== Parliamentary constituencies and MPs ====\n\nLiverpool has four parliamentary constituencies entirely within the city, through which MPs are elected to represent the city in Westminster: Liverpool Riverside, Liverpool Walton, Liverpool Wavertree and Liverpool West Derby. At the last general election, all were won by Labour with representation being from Kim Johnson, Dan Carden, Paula Barker and Ian Byrne respectively. Due to boundary changes prior to the 2010 election, the Liverpool Garston constituency was merged with most of Knowsley South to form the Garston and Halewood cross-boundary seat. At the most 2019 election this seat was won by Maria Eagle of the Labour Party.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Environment ===\n\nLiverpool has been described as having \"the most splendid setting of any English city.\" At 53\u00b024\u20320\u2033N 2\u00b059\u20320\u2033W (53.4, \u22122.98), 176 miles (283 kilometres) northwest of London, located on the Liverpool Bay of the Irish Sea the city of Liverpool is built across a ridge of sandstone hills rising up to a height of around 230 feet (70 m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the West Lancashire Coastal Plain.\nThe Mersey Estuary separates Liverpool from the Wirral Peninsula. The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to Bootle, Crosby and Maghull in south Sefton to the north, and Kirkby, Huyton, Prescot and Halewood in Knowsley to the east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nLiverpool experiences a temperate maritime climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), like much of the British Isles, with relatively mild summers, cool winters and rainfall spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Rainfall and Temperature records have been kept at Bidston since 1867, but records for atmospheric pressure go back as far as at least 1846. Bidston closed down in 2002 but the Met Office also has a weather station at Crosby. Since records began in 1867, temperatures have ranged from \u221217.6 \u00b0C (0.3 \u00b0F) on 21 December 2010 to 34.5 \u00b0C (94.1 \u00b0F) on 2 August 1990, although Liverpool Airport recorded a temperature of 35.0 \u00b0C (95.0 \u00b0F) on 19 July 2006.The lowest amount of sunshine on record was 16.5 hours in December 1927 whereas the most was 314.5 hours in July 2013.Tornado activity or funnel cloud formation is very rare in and around the Liverpool area and tornadoes that do form are usually weak. Recent tornadoes or funnel clouds in Merseyside have been seen in 1998 and 2014.During the period 1981\u20132010, Crosby recorded an average of 32.8 days of air frost per year, which is low for the United Kingdom. Snow is fairly common during the winter although heavy snow is rare. Snow generally falls between November and March but can occasionally fall earlier and later. In recent times, the earliest snowfall was on 1 October 2008 while the latest occurred on 15 May 2012. Although historically, the earliest snowfall occurred on 10 September 1908 and the latest on 2 June 1975.Rainfall, although light, is quite a common occurrence in Liverpool, with the wettest month on record being August 1956, which recorded 221.2 mm (8.71 in) of rain and the driest being February 1932, with 0.9 mm (0.035 in). The driest year on record was 1991, with 480.5 mm (18.92 in) of rainfall and the wettest was 1872, with 1,159.9 mm (45.67 in).\n\n\n=== Human ===\n\n\n==== Suburbs and districts ====\n\nSuburbs and districts of Liverpool include:\n\n\n==== Green Liverpool ====\nIn 2010 Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust Commissioned The Mersey Forest to complete \"A Green Infrastructure Strategy\" for the city.\n\n\n==== Green belt ====\n\nLiverpool is a core urban element of a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.Due to being already highly built up, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within greenfield throughout the borough, at Fazakerley, Croxteth Hall and country park and Craven Wood, Woodfields Park and nearby golf courses in Netherley, small greenfield tracts east of the Speke area by the St Ambrose primary school, and the small hamlet of Oglet and the surrounding area south of Liverpool Airport.The green belt was first drawn up in 1983 under Merseyside County Council and the size in the city amounts to 530 hectares (5.3 km2; 2.0 sq mi).\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\n\n==== The city ====\nAt the 2011 UK Census the recorded population of Liverpool was 466,415, a 6.1% increase on the figure of 439,473 recorded in the 2001 census. The population of the central Liverpool local authority peaked in the 1930s with 846,101 recorded in the 1931 census, before suburbanisation and the establishment of new towns in the region. As with many British cities including London and Manchester, the city centre covered by the Liverpool council area had experienced negative population growth since the 1931 census. Much of the population loss was as a result of large-scale resettlement programmes to nearby areas introduced in the aftermath of the Second World War, with satellite towns such as Kirkby, Skelmersdale and Runcorn seeing a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).Liverpool's population is younger than that of England as a whole, with 42.5 per cent of its population under the age of 30, compared to an English average of 37.7 per cent. As of July 2014, 66 per cent of the population was of working age.\n\n\n==== Urban and metropolitan area ====\nLiverpool is the largest local authority by population, GDP and area in Merseyside. Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Liverpool is defined as a standalone NUTS3 area by the ONS for statistical purpose, and makes up part of the NUTS2 area \"Merseyside\" along with East Merseyside (Knowsley, St Helens and Halton), Sefton and the Wirral. The population of this area was 1,513,306 based on 2014 estimates.\nThe \"Liverpool Urban Area\" is a term used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to denote the urban area around the city to the east of the River Mersey. The contiguous built-up area extends beyond the area administered by Liverpool City Council into adjoining local authority areas, particularly parts of Sefton and Knowsley. As defined by ONS, the area extends as far east as Haydock and St. Helens. Unlike the Metropolitan area, the Urban Area does not include The Wirral or its contiguous areas. The population of this area as of 2011 was 864,211.\nThe \"Liverpool City Region\" is an economic partnership between local authorities in Merseyside under the umbrella of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority as defined by the Mersey Partnership. The area covers Merseyside and the Borough of Halton and has an estimated population between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 and.In 2006 ESPON (now (European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion) released a study defining a \"Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area\" as a functional urban area consisting of contiguous urban areas, labour pool, and commuter \"Travel To Work Areas\". The analysis grouped the Merseyside metropolitan county with the borough of Halton, Wigan in Greater Manchester, the city of Chester as well as number of towns in Lancashire and Cheshire including Ormskirk and Warrington, estimating the polynuclear metropolitan area to have a population of 2,241,000 people.Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area, or megalopolis.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\n\nAccording to data from the 2011 census, 84.8 per cent of Liverpool's population was White British, 1.4 per cent White Irish, 2.6 per cent White Other, 4.1 per cent Asian or Asian British (including 1.1 per cent British Indian and 1.7 per cent British Chinese), 2.6 per cent Black or Black British (including 1.8 per cent Black African) and 2.5 per cent mixed-race. 1.8 per cent of respondents were from other ethnic groups.According to a 2014 survey, the ten most popular surnames of Liverpool (With surname origin), followed with their population are; \n\n1. Jones (Welsh) \u2013 23,012\n2. Smith (English) \u2013 16,276\n3. Williams (Welsh) \u2013 13,997\n4. Davies (Welsh) \u2013 10,149\n5. Hughes (Welsh) \u2013 9,787\n6. Roberts (Welsh) \u2013 9,571\n7. Taylor (English) \u2013 8,219\n8. Johnson (English/Scottish) \u2013 6,715\n9. Brown (English/Scottish) \u2013 6,603\n10. Murphy (Irish) \u2013 6,495Liverpool is home to Britain's oldest Black community, dating to at least the 1730s. Some  Liverpudlians can trace their black ancestry in the city back ten generations. Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men. Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large African-Caribbean, Ghanaian, and Somali communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations.\nThe city is also home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city's Chinatown arrived as seamen in the 19th century. The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest gateway outside China. Liverpool also has a long-standing Filipino community. Lita Roza, a singer from Liverpool who was the first woman to achieve a UK number one hit, had Filipino ancestry.\nThe city is also known for its large Irish population and its historically large Welsh population. In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool's population was Welsh, leading to the city becoming known as \"the capital of North Wales.\" Following the start of the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century, up to two million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently departing for the United States. By 1851, more than 20 per cent of the population of Liverpool was Irish. At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the Republic of Ireland, while 0.54 per cent were born in Northern Ireland, but many more Liverpudlians are of Welsh or Irish ancestry.\nOther contemporary ethnicities include Indian, Latin American, Malaysian, and Yemeni communities, which number several thousand each.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings, including two Christian cathedrals.\nLiverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England.The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican Our Lady and St Nicholas, colloquially known as \"the sailors church\", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style), and the Gustav Adolf Church (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles).\nLiverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The Anglican Cathedral, which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, has one of the longest naves, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, on Mount Pleasant next to Liverpool Science Park, was initially planned to be even larger. Of Sir Edwin Lutyens's original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick Gibberd. While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design it still incorporates the largest panel of stained glass in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called Hope Street, a coincidence which pleases believers. The cathedral is colloquially referred to as \"Paddy's Wigwam\" due to its shape.\n\nLiverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed Moorish Revival Princes Road Synagogue is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's Moorish Revival synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool. Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant Jewish community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the Greenbank Park area of L17 has recently closed and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a Lubavitch Chabad House and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000. The Liverpool Talmudical College existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue.\nLiverpool also has a Hindu community, with a Mandir on Edge Lane, Edge Hill. The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there. Liverpool also has the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Wavertree and a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Centre in the same area.The city had the earliest mosque in England, and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by William Abdullah Quilliam, a lawyer who had converted to Islam, and set up the Liverpool Muslim Institute in a terraced house on West Derby Road. The building was used as a house of worship until 1908, when it was sold to the City Council and converted into offices. Plans have been accepted to re-convert the building where the mosque once stood into a museum. There are three mosques in Liverpool: the largest and main one, Al-Rahma mosque, in the Toxteth area of the city and a mosque recently opened in the Mossley Hill district of the city. The third mosque was also recently opened in Toxteth and is on Granby Street.\n\n\n=== Demonymy and identity ===\nNatives of the city of Liverpool are referred to as Liverpudlians, and colloquially as \"Scousers\", a reference to \"scouse\", a form of stew. The word \"Scouse\" has also become synonymous with the Liverpool accent and dialect. Many people \"self-identify\" as Liverpudlians or Scousers without actually being born or living within the city boundaries of Liverpool.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Economy of Liverpool is one of the largest within the United Kingdom, sitting at the centre of one of the two core economies within the North West of England. In 2006, the city's GVA was \u00a37,626 million, providing a per capita figure of \u00a317,489, which was above the North West average. Liverpool's economy has seen strong growth since the mid-1990s, with its GVA increasing 71.8% between 1995 and 2006 and employment increasing 12% between 1998 and 2006. GDP per capita was estimated to stand at $32,121 in 2014, and total GDP at $65.8 billion.In common with much of the rest of the UK today, Liverpool's economy is dominated by service sector industries, both public and private. In 2007, over 60% of all employment in the city was in the public administration, education, health, banking, finance and insurance sectors. Over recent years there has also been significant growth in the knowledge economy of Liverpool with the establishment of the Liverpool Knowledge Quarter in sectors such as media and life sciences. Liverpool's rich architectural base has also helped the city become the second most filmed city in the UK outside London, including doubling for Chicago, London, Moscow, New York, Paris and Rome.\n\nAnother important component of Liverpool's economy are the tourism and leisure sectors. Liverpool is the sixth most visited UK city and one of the 100 most visited cities in the world by international tourists. In 2008, during the city's European Capital of Culture celebrations, overnight visitors brought \u00a3188m into the local economy, while tourism as a whole is worth approximately \u00a31.3bn a year to Liverpool. The city's new cruise liner terminal, which is situated close to the Pier Head, also makes Liverpool One of the few places in the world where cruise ships are able to berth right in the centre of the city. Other recent developments in Liverpool such as the Echo Arena and Liverpool One have made Liverpool an important leisure centre with the latter helping to lift Liverpool into the top five retail destinations in the UK. \nHistorically, the economy of Liverpool was centred on the city's port and manufacturing base, although a smaller proportion of total employment is today derived from the port. Nonetheless the city remains one of the most important ports in the United Kingdom, handling over 32.2m tonnes of cargo in 2008. A new multimillion-pound expansion to the Port of Liverpool, Liverpool2, is scheduled to be operational from the end of 2015, and is projected to greatly increase the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle. Liverpool is also home to the UK headquarters of many shipping lines including Japanese firm NYK and Danish firm Maersk Line, whilst shipping firm Atlantic Container Line has recently invested significant amounts in expanding its Liverpool operations, with a new headquarters currently under construction. Future plans to redevelop the city's northern dock system, in a project known as Liverpool Waters, could see \u00a35.5bn invested in the city over the next 50 years, creating 17,000 new jobs.Car manufacturing also takes place in the city at the Jaguar Land Rover Halewood plant where the Range Rover Evoque model is assembled. In 2016 it was reported that The Beatles contribute \u00a382 million a year to Liverpool's economy and are a direct result of 2,335 jobs.\n\n\n== Landmarks and recent development projects ==\n\nLiverpool's history means that there are a considerable variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture. The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the British Empire. There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed and 85 are Grade II* listed. The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster and more Georgian houses than the city of Bath. This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage, as England's finest Victorian city.The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of international trade and docking technology. However this status was revoked in July 2021, when UNESCO resolved that recent and proposed developments, such as the Bramley-Moore Dock stadium and Liverpool Waters projects, had resulted in the \"serious deterioration\" of the area's significance.\n\n\n=== Waterfront and docks ===\n\nAs a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed wet dock (the Old Dock) in 1715 and the first ever hydraulic lifting cranes. The best-known dock in Liverpool is the Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool, which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain. Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley, it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. The Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum, Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story. North of the city centre is Stanley Dock, home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head, renowned for the trio of buildings \u2013 the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building \u2013 which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the Three Graces, these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built-in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of Maritime Liverpool and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.\n\nIn recent years, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Amongst the notable recent developments are the Museum of Liverpool, the construction of the Liverpool Arena and BT Convention Centre on Kings Dock, Alexandra Tower and 1 Princes Dock on Prince's Dock and Liverpool Marina around Coburg and Brunswick Docks. The Wheel of Liverpool opened on 25 March 2010.However, plans to redevelop parts of the Liverpool have been marred by controversy. In December 2016, a newly formed company called North Point Global Ltd. was given the rights to develop part of the docks under the \"New Chinatown\" banner. Though heavily advertised in Liverpool, Hong Kong and Chinese cities with glossy advertisements and videos, the \"New Chinatown\" development failed to materialise. In January 2018, the Liverpool Echo and Asia Times revealed that the site remained sans any construction, North Point Global as well as its subcontractor \"Bilt\" had both declared bankruptcy, and the small investors (mostly middle class couples) who had already paid money for the apartments had lost most of their savings in them. Five similar development projects, mostly targeting individual Chinese and Hong Kong based citizens, were suspended due to financial misappropriations.\n\n\n=== Commercial district and cultural quarter ===\n\nLiverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought, then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.The commercial district is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their medieval layout. Having developed over a period of three centuries the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's former World Heritage site.\n\nThe oldest building in the area is the Grade I listed Liverpool Town Hall, which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of Georgian architecture, the building is known as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain. Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed Bank of England Building, constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank. Amongst the other buildings in the area are the Tower Buildings, Albion House (the former White Star Line headquarters), the Municipal Buildings and Oriel Chambers, which is considered to be one of the earliest Modernist style buildings ever built.\n\nThe area around William Brown Street is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the William Brown Library, Walker Art Gallery, Picton Reading Rooms and World Museum Liverpool. The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture, of which the most prominent, St George's Hall, is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe. A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with \"S.P.Q.L.\" (Latin senatus populusque Liverpudliensis), meaning \"the senate and people of Liverpool\". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including Wellington's Column and the Steble Fountain. Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John's Gardens, which was specifically developed for this purpose. The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the Roman Forum.\n\n\n=== Other notable landmarks ===\n\nWhile the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall, a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598. The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interiors, which was added in the mid-19th century. In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall, which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.\nThe oldest building within the city centre is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers, which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style, the building was influenced in part by the work of Christopher Wren and was originally the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to a larger site in Wavertree in the south of the city). Since 1908 it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.\n\nLiverpool is noted for having two Cathedrals, each of which imposes over the landscape around it. The Anglican Cathedral, which was constructed between 1904 and 1978, is the largest Cathedral in Britain and the fifth largest in the world. Designed and built in Gothic style, it is regarded as one of the greatest buildings to have been constructed during the 20th century and was described by former British Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, as 'one of the great buildings of the world'. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is known as one of the first Cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design.In recent years, many parts of Liverpool's city centre have undergone significant redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. The largest of these developments has been Liverpool One, which has seen almost \u00a31 billion invested in the redevelopment of 42 acres (17 hectares) of land, providing new retail, commercial, residential and leisure space. Around the north of the city centre several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including the RIBA award-winning Unity Buildings and West Tower, which at 140m is Liverpool's tallest building. Many redevelopment schemes are also in progress including Central Village / Circus, the Lime Street gateway, and the highly ambitious Liverpool Waters.There are many other notable buildings in Liverpool, including the art deco former terminal building of Speke Airport, the University of Liverpool's Victoria Building, (which provided the inspiration for the term Red Brick University), and the Adelphi Hotel, which was in that past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nThe English Heritage National Register of Historic Parks describes Merseyside's Victorian Parks as collectively the \"most important in the country\". The city of Liverpool has ten listed parks and cemeteries, including two Grade I and five Grade II*, more than any other English city apart from London.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nTransport in Liverpool is primarily centred on the city's road and rail networks, both of which are extensive and provide links across the United Kingdom. Liverpool has an extensive local public transport network, which is managed by Merseytravel, and includes buses, trains and ferries. Additionally, the city also has an international airport and a major port, both of which provides links to locations outside the country.\n\n\n=== National and international travel ===\n\n\n==== Road links ====\nAs a major city, Liverpool has direct road links with many other areas within England. To the east, the M62 motorway connects Liverpool with Hull and along the route provides links to several large cities, including Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The M62 also provides a connection to both the M6 and M1 motorways, providing indirect links to more distant areas including Birmingham, London, Nottingham, Preston and Sheffield. To the west of the city, the Kingsway and Queensway Tunnels connect Liverpool with the Wirral Peninsula, including Birkenhead, and Wallasey. The A41 road and M53 motorway, which both begin in Birkenhead, link to Cheshire and Shropshire and via the A55, to North Wales. To the south, Liverpool is connected to Widnes and Warrington via the A562 and across the River Mersey to Runcorn, via the Silver Jubilee and Mersey Gateway bridges.\n\n\n==== Rail links ====\nLiverpool is served by two separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by Merseyrail and provides links throughout Merseyside and beyond (see Local travel below), while the national network, which is managed by Network Rail, provides Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across England. The city's primary mainline station is Lime Street station, which is the terminus for several lines into the city, with numerous destinations, including London (in 2 hours 8 minutes with Pendolino trains), Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne, Manchester, Preston, Leeds, Scarborough, Sheffield, Nottingham and Norwich. In the south of the city, Liverpool South Parkway provides a connection to the city's airport.\n\n\n==== Port ====\nThe Port of Liverpool is one of Britain's largest ports, providing passenger ferry services across the Irish Sea to Belfast, Dublin and the Isle of Man. Services are provided by several companies, including the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, P&O Ferries and Stena Line. In 2007, a new cruise terminal was opened in Liverpool, located alongside the Pier Head in the city centre.\nNovember 2016 saw the official opening of Liverpool2, an extension to the port that allows post-Panamax vessels to dock in Liverpool.Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs into Liverpool city centre via Liverpool Canal Link at Pier Head since 2009.Liverpool Cruise Terminal in the city centre provides long-distance passenger cruises, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines MS Black Watch and Cruise & Maritime Voyages MS Magellan using the terminal to depart to Iceland, France, Spain and Norway.\n\n\n==== Airport ====\n\nLiverpool John Lennon Airport, which is located in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections across the United Kingdom and Europe. In 2008, the airport handled over 5.3 million passengers and today offers services to 68 destinations, including Berlin, Rome, Milan, Paris, Barcelona and Z\u00fcrich. The airport is primarily served by low-cost airlines, notably Ryanair and Easyjet, although it does provide additional charter services in the summer.\n\n\n=== Local travel ===\n\n\n==== Trains ====\n\nLiverpool's local rail network is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. The network consists of three lines: the Northern Line, which runs to Southport, Ormskirk, Kirkby and Hunts Cross; the Wirral Line, which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to New Brighton, West Kirby, Chester and Ellesmere Port; and the City Line, which begins at Lime Street, providing links to St Helens, Wigan, Preston, Warrington and Manchester.\nThe network is predominantly electric. Electrification of the City Line was completed in 2015. The two lines operated by Merseyrail are the busiest British urban commuter networks outside London, covering 75 miles (120 kilometres) of track, with an average of 110,000 passenger journeys per weekday. Services are operated by the Merseyrail franchise and managed by Merseytravel. Local services on the City Line are operated by Northern rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within the city centre the majority of the network is underground, with four city centre stations and over 6+1\u20442 miles (10.5 kilometres) of tunnels.\n\n\n==== Buses ====\n\nLocal bus services within and around Liverpool are managed by Merseytravel and are run by several different companies, including Arriva and Stagecoach. The two principal termini for local buses are Queen Square bus station (located near Lime Street railway station) for services north and east of the city, and Liverpool One bus station (located near the Albert Dock) for services to the south and east. Cross-river services to the Wirral use roadside terminus points in Castle Street and Sir Thomas Street. A night bus service also operates on Saturdays providing services from the city centre across Liverpool and Merseyside.\nCity Sights and City explorer by Maghull coaches offer a tour bus service.\nNational Express also operates.\n\n\n==== Mersey Ferry ====\nThe cross river ferry service in Liverpool, known as the Mersey Ferry, is managed and operated by Merseytravel, with services operating between the Pier Head in Liverpool and both Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey. Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes at peak times, to every hour during the middle of the day and during weekends. Despite remaining an important transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the River Mersey and surrounding areas.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nIn May 2014, the CityBike hire scheme was launched in the city. The scheme provides access to over 1,000 bikes stationed at over 140 docking stations across the city.National Cycle Route 56, National Cycle Route 62 and National Cycle Route 810 run through Liverpool.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAs with other large cities, Liverpool is an important cultural centre within the United Kingdom, incorporating music, performing arts, museums and art galleries, literature and nightlife amongst others. In 2008, the cultural heritage of the city was celebrated with the city holding the title of European Capital of Culture, during which time a wide range of cultural celebrations took place in the city, including Go Superlambananas! and La Princesse. Liverpool has also held Europe's largest music and poetry event, the Welsh national Eisteddfod, three times, despite being in England, in 1884, 1900, and 1929.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nLiverpool is internationally known for music and is recognised by Guinness World Records as the World Capital City of Pop. Musicians from the city have produced 56 No. 1 singles, more than any other city in the world. Both the most successful male band and girl group in global music history have contained Liverpudlian members. Liverpool is most famous as the birthplace of the Beatles and during the 1960s was at the forefront of the Beat Music movement, which would eventually lead to the British Invasion. Many notable musicians of the time originated in the city including Billy J. Kramer, Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers. The influence of musicians from Liverpool, coupled with other cultural exploits of the time, such as the Liverpool poets, prompted American poet Allen Ginsberg to proclaim that the city was \"the centre of consciousness of the human universe\". Other musicians from Liverpool include Billy Fury, A Flock of Seagulls, Echo & the Bunnymen, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Frankie Vaughan, Anathema, Ladytron, The Zutons, Cast, Atomic Kitten and Rebecca Ferguson. The La's 1990 hit single \"There She Goes\" was described by Rolling Stone as a \"founding piece of Britpop's foundation.\"\n\nThe city is also home to the oldest surviving professional symphony orchestra in the UK, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, which is based in the Philharmonic Hall. The chief conductor of the orchestra is Vasily Petrenko. Sir Edward Elgar dedicated his Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 to the Liverpool Orchestral Society, and the piece had its first performance in the city in 1901. Among Liverpool's curiosities, the Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Fritz Spiegl is notable. He not only became a world expert on the etymology of Scouse, but composed the music to Z-cars and the Radio 4 UK Theme.\nThe Mathew Street Festival is an annual street festival that is one of the most important musical events in Liverpool's calendar. It is Europe's largest free music event and takes place every August. Other well established festivals in the city include Africa Oy\u00e9 and Brazilica which are the UK's largest free African and Brazilian music festivals respectively. The dance music festival Creamfields was established by the Liverpool-based Cream clubbing brand which started life as a weekly event at Nation nightclub. There are numerous music venues located across the city, however the Echo Arena is by far the largest. Opened in 2008 the 11,000-seat arena hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards the same year and since then has held host to world-renowned acts such as Andrea Bocelli, Beyonc\u00e9, Elton John, Kanye West, Kasabian, The Killers, Lady Gaga, Oasis, Pink, Rihanna, UB40.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n\nLiverpool has more galleries and national museums than any other city in the United Kingdom apart from London. National Museums Liverpool is the only English national collection based wholly outside London. The Tate Liverpool gallery houses the modern art collection of the Tate in the North of England and was, until the opening of Tate Modern, the largest exhibition space dedicated to modern art in the United Kingdom. The FACT centre hosts touring multimedia exhibitions, while the Walker Art Gallery houses one of the most impressive permanent collections of Pre-Raphaelite art in the world. Sudley House contains another major collection of pre-20th-century art. Liverpool University's Victoria Building was re-opened as a public art gallery and museum to display the University's artwork and historical collections which include the largest display of art by Audubon outside the US. A number of artists have also come from the city, including painter George Stubbs who was born in Liverpool in 1724.\nThe Liverpool Biennial festival of arts runs from mid-September to late November and comprises three main sections; the International, The Independents and New Contemporaries although fringe events are timed to coincide. It was during the 2004 festival that Yoko Ono's work \"My mother is beautiful\" caused widespread public protest when photographs of a naked woman's pubic area were exhibited on the main shopping street.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nFelicia Hemans (n\u00e9e Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of the Venetian consul in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to Denbighshire in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and St. Asaph (Flintshire), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as \"Land of my childhood, my home and my dead\". Her first poems, dedicated to the Prince of Wales, were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of Percy Bysshe Shelley, who briefly corresponded with her.\nA number of notable authors have visited Liverpool, including Daniel Defoe, Washington Irving, Thomas De Quincey, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Charles Dickens, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Hugh Walpole. Daniel Defoe, after visiting the city, described it, as \"one of the wonders of Britain in his 'Tour through England and Wales'\".Herman Melville's novel Redburn deals with the first seagoing voyage of 19 years old Wellingborough Redburn between New York and Liverpool in 1839. Largely autobiographical, the middle sections of the book are set in Liverpool and describe the young merchantman's wanderings, and his reflections. Hawthorne was stationed in Liverpool as United States consul between 1853 and 1856. Charles Dickens visited the city on numerous occasions to give public readings. Hopkins served as priest at St Francis Xavier Church, Langdale St., Liverpool, between 1879 and 81. Although he is not known to have ever visited Liverpool, Jung famously had a vivid dream of the city which he analysed in one of his works.Of all the poets who are connected with Liverpool, perhaps the greatest is Constantine P. Cavafy, a twentieth-century Greek cultural icon, although he was born in Alexandria. From a wealthy family, his father had business interests in Egypt, London and Liverpool. After his father's death, Cavafy's mother brought him in 1872 at the age of nine to Liverpool, where he spent part of his childhood being educated. He lived first in Balmoral Road, then when the family firm crashed, he lived in poorer circumstances in Huskisson Street. After his father died in 1870, Cavafy and his family settled for a while in Liverpool. In 1876, his family faced financial problems due to the Long Depression of 1873, so, by 1877, they had to move back to Alexandria.Her Benny, a novel telling the tragic story of Liverpool street urchins in the 1870s, written by Methodist preacher Silas K. Hocking, was a best-seller and the first book to sell a million copies in the author's lifetime. The prolific writer of adventure novels, Harold Edward Bindloss (1866\u20131945), was born in Liverpool.\nThe writer, docker and political activist George Garrett was born in Secombe, on the Wirral Peninsula in 1896 and was brought up in Liverpool's South end, around Park Road, the son of a fierce Liverpool\u2013Irish Catholic mother and a staunch 'Orange' stevedore father. In the 1920s and 1930s, his organisation within the Seamen's Vigilance Committees, unemployed demonstrations, and hunger marches from Liverpool became part of a wider cultural force. He spoke at reconciliation meetings in sectarian Liverpool, and helped found the Unity Theatre in the 1930s as part of the Popular Front against the rise of fascism, particularly its echoes in the Spanish Civil War. Garrett died in 1966.The novelist and playwright James Hanley (1897\u20131985) was born in Kirkdale, Liverpool, in 1897 (not Dublin, nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working-class family. Hanley grew up close to the docks and much of his early writing is about seamen. The Furys (1935) is first in a sequence of five loosely autobiographical novels about working-class life in Liverpool. James Hanley's brother, novelist Gerald Hanley (1916\u201392) was also born in Liverpool (not County Cork, Ireland, as he claimed). While he published a number of novels he also wrote radio plays for the BBC as well as some film scripts, most notably The Blue Max (1966). He was also one of several scriptwriters for a life of Gandhi (1964). Novelist Beryl Bainbridge (1932\u20132010) was born in Liverpool and raised in nearby Formby. She was primarily known for her works of psychological fiction, often set among the English working classes. Bainbridge won the Whitbread Awards prize for best novel in 1977 and 1996 and was nominated five times for the Booker Prize. The Times newspaper named Bainbridge among their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".J. G. Farrell was born in Liverpool in 1935 but left at the outbreak of war in 1939. A novelist of Irish descent, Farrell gained prominence for his historical fiction, most notably his Empire Trilogy (Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip), dealing with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. However, his career ended when he drowned in Ireland in 1979 at the age of 44.\nHelen Forrester was the pen name of June Bhatia (n\u00e9e Huband) (1919\u20132011), who was known for her books about her early childhood in Liverpool during the Great Depression, including Twopence to Cross the Mersey (1974), as well as several works of fiction. During the late 1960s the city became well known for the Liverpool poets, who include Roger McGough and the late Adrian Henri. An anthology of poems, The Mersey Sound, written by Henri, McGough and Brian Patten, has sold well since it was first being published in 1967.\nLiverpool has produced several noted writers of horror fiction, often set on Merseyside \u2013 Ramsey Campbell, Clive Barker and Peter Atkins among them. A collection of Liverpudlian horror fiction, Spook City was edited by a Liverpool expatriate, Angus Mackenzie, and introduced by Doug Bradley, also from Liverpool. Bradley is famed for portraying Barker's creation Pinhead in the Hellraiser series of films.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nLiverpool also has a long history of performing arts, reflected in several annual theatre festivals such as the Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, which takes place inside Liverpool Cathedral and in the adjacent historic St James' Gardens every summer; the Everyword Festival of new theatre writing, the only one of its kind in the country; Physical Fest, an international festival of physical theatre; the annual festivals organised by Liverpool John Moores University's drama department and the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts; and other festivals by the large number of theatres in the city, such as the Empire, Epstein, Everyman, Playhouse, Royal Court, and Unity theatres.\nNotable actors and actresses from Liverpool include Arthur Askey, Tom Baker, Kim Cattrall, Jodie Comer, Stephen Graham, Rex Harrison, Jason Isaacs, Tina Malone, the McGann brothers (Joe, Mark, Paul, and Stephen), David Morrissey, Elizabeth Morton, Peter Serafinowicz, Elisabeth Sladen, Alison Steadman, and Rita Tushingham. Actors and actresses from elsewhere in the world have strong ties to the city, such as Canadian actor Mike Myers (whose parents were both from Liverpool) and American actress Halle Berry (whose mother was from Liverpool).\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nLiverpool has a thriving and varied nightlife, with the majority of the city's late-night bars, pubs, nightclubs, live music venues and comedy clubs being located in a number of distinct districts. A 2011 TripAdvisor poll voted Liverpool as having the best nightlife of any UK city, ahead of Manchester, Leeds and even London. Concert Square, St. Peter's Square and the adjoining Seel, Duke and Hardman Streets are home to some of Liverpool's largest and most famed nightclubs including Alma de Cuba, Blue Angel, Korova, The Krazyhouse (Now Electrik Warehouse), The Magnet, Nation (home of the Cream brand, and Medication, the UK's largest and longest-running weekly student event), Popworld as well as numerous other smaller establishments and chain bars. Another popular nightlife destination in the city centre is Mathew Street and the Gay Quarter, located close to the city's commercial district, this area is famed for The Cavern Club alongside numerous gay bars including Garlands and G-Bar. The Albert Dock and Lark Lane in Aigburth also contain an abundance of bars and late-night venues.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nIn Liverpool primary and secondary education is available in various forms supported by the state including secular, Church of England, Jewish, and Roman Catholic. Islamic education is available at primary level, but there is no secondary provision.\nOne of Liverpool's important early schools was The Liverpool Blue Coat School; founded in 1708 as a charitable school.\nThe Liverpool Blue Coat School is the top-performing school in the city with 100% 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE resulting in the 30th best GCSE results in the country and an average point score per student of 1087.4 in A/AS levels. Other notable schools include Liverpool College founded in 1840 Merchant Taylors' School founded in 1620. Another of Liverpool's notable senior schools is St. Edward's College situated in the West Derby area of the city. Historic grammar schools, such as the Liverpool Institute High School and Liverpool Collegiate School\u2014both closed in the 1980s\u2014are still remembered as centres of academic excellence. Bellerive Catholic College is the city's top-performing non-selective school, based upon GCSE results in 2007.\n\nLiverpool has three universities: the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and Liverpool Hope University. Edge Hill University, founded as a teacher-training college in the Edge Hill district of Liverpool, is now located in Ormskirk in South-West Lancashire. Liverpool is also home to the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA).\nThe University of Liverpool was established in 1881 as University College Liverpool. In 1884, it became part of the federal Victoria University. Following a Royal Charter and Act of Parliament in 1903, it became an independent university, the University of Liverpool, with the right to confer its own degrees. It was the first university to offer degrees in biochemistry, architecture, civic design, veterinary science, oceanography and social science.\n\nLiverpool Hope University, which was formed through the merger of three colleges, the earliest of which was founded in 1844, gained university status in 2005. It is the only ecumenical university in Europe. It is situated on both sides of Taggart Avenue in Childwall and has a second campus in the city centre (the Cornerstone).\nThe Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, founded to address some of the problems created by trade, continues today as a post-graduate school affiliated with the University of Liverpool and houses an anti-venom repository.\nLiverpool John Moores University was previously a polytechnic, and gained status in 1992. It is named in honour of Sir John Moores, one of the founders of the Littlewoods football pools and retail group, who was a major benefactor. The institution was previously owned and run by Liverpool City Council. It traces it lineage to the Liverpool Mechanics Institute, opened in 1823, making it by this measure England's third-oldest university.\nThe city has one further education college, Liverpool Community College in the city centre. Liverpool City Council operates Burton Manor, a residential adult education college in nearby Burton, on the Wirral Peninsula.\nThere are two Jewish schools in Liverpool, both belonging to the King David Foundation. King David School, Liverpool is the High School and the King David Primary School. There is also a King David Kindergarten, featured in the community centre of Harold House. These schools are all run by the King David Foundation located in Harold House in Childwall; conveniently next door to the Childwall Synagogue.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nLiverpool is one of the most successful footballing cities in England, and is home to two top flight Premier League teams. Everton F.C. was founded in 1878 and play at Goodison Park and Liverpool F.C. were founded in 1892 and play at Anfield. Between them, the clubs have won 28 English First Division titles, 12 FA Cup titles, 10 League Cup titles, 6 European Cup titles, 1 FIFA Club World Cup title, 1 European Cup Winners' Cup title, 3 UEFA Cup titles, and 24 FA Charity Shields.\nThe two clubs contest the Merseyside derby, dubbed the 'friendly derby'. Despite the name the fixture is known for its keen rivalry, having seen more sending-offs in this fixture than any other. Unlike many other derbies it is not rare for families in the city to contain supporters of both clubs. Liverpool F.C. is the English and British club with the most European Cup titles with six, the latest in 2019.\n\nLiverpool has played at Anfield since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following Everton's departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 125 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994\u201395) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield is classified as a 4 Star UEFA Elite Stadium with capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy.\n\nAfter leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to Goodison Park on the opposite side of Stanley Park.The ground was opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA but the first crowds to attend the ground saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4\u20132. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new goal-end stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Main Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the other two stands are refurbished pre-Second World War structures.\nEverton is currently in the process of relocating, with a stadium move mooted as early as 1996. In 2003, the club were forced to abandon plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's Dock due to financial constraints, with further proposed moves to Kirkby (comprising part of Destination Kirkby, moving the stadium just beyond Liverpool's council boundary into Kirkby) and Walton Hall Park similarly scrapped. The latest plan is a move to nearby Bramley-Moore Dock on Liverpool's waterfront, with ground broken on the project in August 2021.\n\n\n=== Rugby league ===\nRugby league is a developing sport in Liverpool, with many community partners assisting the sport's governing body (RFL) to offer opportunities to participate.

The king hath a castelet there, and the Earl of Darbe hath a stone howse there. Irisch merchants cum much thither, as to a good haven ... At Lyrpole is smaul custom payed, that causith marchantes to resorte thither. Good marchandis at Lyrpole, and much Irish yarrn that Manchester men do buy there ...\" \u2013 John Leland, Itinerary, c. 1536\u20131539\n\"Liverpoole is one of the wonders of Britain ... In a word, there is no town in England, London excepted, that can equal [it] for the fineness of the streets, and the beauty of the buildings.\" \u2013 Daniel Defoe, A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain, 1721\u20131726\n\"[O]ne of the neatest, best towns I have seen in England.\" \u2013 John Wesley. Journal, 1755\n\"I have not come here to be insulted by a set of wretches, every brick in whose infernal town is cemented with an African's blood.\" \u2013 George Frederick Cooke (1756\u20131812), an actor responding to being hissed at when he came onstage drunk during a visit to Liverpool\n\"That immense City which stands like another Venice upon the water ... where there are riches overflowing and every thing which can delight a man who wishes to see the prosperity of a great community and a great empire ... This quondam village, now fit to be the proud capital of any empire in the world, has started up like an enchanted palace even in the memory of living men.\" \u2013 Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine, 1791\n\"I have heard of the greatness of Liverpool, but the reality far surpasses my expectation.\" \u2013 Prince Albert, speech, 1846\n\"Liverpool ... has become a wonder of the world. It is the New York of Europe, a world city rather than merely British provincial.\" \u2013 Illustrated London News, 15 May 1886\n\"The dream represented my situation at the time. I can still see the greyish-yellow raincoats, glistening with the wetness of the rain. Everything was extremely unpleasant, black and opaque \u2013 just as I felt then. But I had a vision of unearthly beauty, and that is why I was able to live at all. Liverpool is the \u201cpool of life.\u201d The \u201cliver,\u201d according to an old view, is the seat of life, that which makes to live.\" \u2013 C. G. Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, 1928\n\"The centre is imposing, dignified and darkish, like a city in a rather gloomy Victorian novel ... We had now arrived in the heart of the big city, and as usual it was almost a heart of darkness. But it looked like a big city, there was no denying that. Here, emphatically, was the English seaport second only to London. The very weight of stone emphasised that fact. And even if the sun never seems to properly rise over it, I like a big city to proclaim itself a big city at once...\" \u2013 J. B. Priestley, English Journey, 1934\n\"If Liverpool can get into top gear again, there is no limit to the city's potential. The scale and resilience of the buildings and people is amazing \u2013 it is a world city, far more so than London and Manchester. It doesn't feel like anywhere else in Lancashire: comparisons always end up overseas \u2013 Dublin, or Boston, or Hamburg. The city is tremendous, and so, right up to the First World War, were the abilities of the architects who built over it. The centre is humane and convenient to walk around in, but never loses its scale. And, in spite of the bombings and the carelessness, it is still full of superb buildings. Fifty years ago it must have outdone anything in England.\" \u2013 Ian Nairn, Britain's Changing Towns, 1967\n\n\n== International links ==\n\n\n=== Twin cities ===\nLiverpool is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Friendship links ===\nLiverpool has friendship links (without formal constitution) with the following cities:\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThe first overseas consulate of the United States was opened in Liverpool in 1790, and it remained operational for almost two centuries.

            "\"Build a Bitch\" (edited for radio as \"Build a Babe\" or \"Build a B\") is the debut single by Filipino-American social media personality Bella Poarch, released through Warner Records on May 14, 2021. An accompanying music video was released alongside the single.",

            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_a_Bitch",
            "\"Build a Bitch\" (edited for radio as \"Build a Babe\" or \"Build a B\") is the debut single by Filipino-American social media personality Bella Poarch, released through Warner Records on May 14, 2021. An accompanying music video was released alongside the single.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nFollowing her success on social media, Poarch signed a record label deal with Warner Records. \"I feel like I found my family and part of that family is the label,\" Poarch says of signing to Warner in a statement to Billboard. \"When I looked up some of the artists that meant the most to me musically like Prince, Dua Lipa, and Madonna, I realized Warner has helped all of those people along the way too. So I'm very honored to have a family that gave me a chance and believes in me.\" Poarch adds, \"I've been singing and writing songs my whole life but to put together something special in this way and to have this opportunity... it's something I'll forever be grateful for. This is just the beginning.\" She is said to deliver \"her own dynamic and diverse brand of dark pop\".The sheet music for \"Build a Bitch\" is published in the key of E-flat major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 103 beats per minute. Poarch's vocal range spans from B\u266d3 to C5.\n\n\n=== Production ===\nMade in collaboration with producer-songwriter Sub Urban, Poarch shares that the track was inspired by the direct scrutiny she received online. \"Build a Bitch\" is about accepting yourself for who you are instead of listening to other people's ideas of what you should do or how you should look. \"I hope it helps people to feel more confident and good about themselves, and also reminds them not to judge anyone else,\" she says via a press statement. The song's cover art was made by popular artist 'YaLocalOffgod.'\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe song received positive reviews from critics and fans-alike for her vocal performance and the song's lyricism. Hattie Collins of Vogue said that the song \"demonstrates both her innate musical talent and ambitions as an artist. Deftly dismantling the impossible standards of beauty that we are put under.\" Collins also noted that the song is \"incredibly\" catchy and, \"unsurprisingly\", a hit on TikTok. The New York Times said of the video, \"Poarch is coming into her own music [and] 'Build a Bitch' comes across cute and furious.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nDirected by Andrew Donoho and creatively directed by Sub Urban, the music video for \"Build A Bitch\" premiered alongside the single on May 14, 2021. The video features a shop where boys can create their ideal girl, similar to a Build-A-Bear Workshop. A multitude of parts are created for assembly per varying customer preferences, but no one picks the \"beta version\" of Poarch. She is labeled as \"defective\" and sent into a lava pit for disposal, but manages to override the system and be summoned for a boy, whom she then beats up. Poarch destroys the machine responsible for making the girls, frees the other prototypes, and burns the factory down.The music video included cameos from Valkyrae, Mia Khalifa, Bretman Rock, Larray, ZHC, Dina, Rakhim, and Sub Urban.  Having garnered 15.5 million views within the first day of release, it became the most-viewed music video in its first 24 hours by Warner Music.\nIn less than a week, it was viewed 70 million times on the platform. As of March 2022, it has over 370 million views.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Butter\" is a song recorded by South Korean boy band BTS. It was released as a digital single on May 21, 2021, through Big Hit Music and Sony Music Entertainment, as the band's second English-language single. A disco-pop, dance-pop, and EDM track, the song was written by Jenna Andrews, RM, Alex Bilowitz, Sebastian Garcia, Robert Grimaldi, Stephen Kirk, and Ron Perry, with production handled by the latter three.

The song also reached the top 10 in over 30 other countries worldwide. A remix featuring American rapper Megan Thee Stallion was also released.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nSpeaking on how \"Butter\" came about, Variety quoted RM in an interview with Apple Music as saying that \"[the band] never expected to release another single, but the virus is getting longer and longer so we thought we need another summer song. We thought we needed another summer number, and 'Butter' was perfectly fit for that. And now we're here\". J-Hope described the recording process as \"smooth\" and the song as \"focus[ed] more on showing each of the members' charms compared with 'Dynamite'\".\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nInitial reports about \"Butter\" called it \"a dance pop track brimming with the smooth yet charismatic charm of BTS\". Rolling Stone described it as \"a pure, swaggering dance-pop celebration in the retro vein of Bruno Mars, with layers of Jam and Lewis-style synths\", and RM told the outlet that the song \"[is] very energetic\" and \"very summery\". Forbes called it an \"infectious disco-pop track\" similar to \"Dynamite\", with a \"pulsating, bass-heavy beat and delectable chorus\". Following its release, \"Butter\" was categorized as a 1980s and 1990s-influenced dance-pop and EDM song with elements of pop rap. The song is in 44 common time in the key of A-flat major with a tempo of 110 beats per minute. BTS' vocal range span from A\u266d3 to E\u266d5.At a press conference held on the day of the song's release, RM revealed that while the band wanted to participate in the writing of their next single, they believed \"Butter\" already sounded \"pretty good\" and \"pretty complete\" when they received it, so they chose it out of \"many, many songs\" that had been sent to them for consideration. He further explained however, that he \"changed or added to about half of the song's original rap sections\" because \"some of the parts like the rap were not fully compatible with our style\", and despite there still being \"some gaps\" in his fluency with English \"it came together really quickly since there weren't that many rap sections in the song\". Suga also tried writing for the song, as he had actively been studying English during the year prior, but the language barrier was still a problem, so his suggestions were \"immediately dropped. No questions, no consideration \u2014 just immediately binned\". Lyrically, like \"Dynamite\", \"Butter\" has \"no heavy message\"; Jimin noted that there was no profound meaning behind the track and that the goal was for it to be \"easy to listen to\".A video teaser released on May 18 offered the first preview of the song's lyrics; the line \"Get it! Let it roll!\" was briefly heard at the end of the clip. Korean news media later reported that the lyrics to \"Butter\" \"cutely confess a sweet, romantic love\", and had \"BTS' smooth-like-butter unrivalled charms melted into the song\".\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nOn April 5, 2021, days after the release of their Japanese single \"Film Out\", it was revealed that BTS would release a new song in May. However, Big Hit Music announced that \"we will reveal our artists' plans after they are finalized\". On April 26, the single's title and release date were announced in an hour-long YouTube livestream of an animated stick of butter melting. The video featured a countdown with kitchen sounds in the background, and the text \"Butter\" and \"May 21, 2021\" appeared at the end of the stream. The livestream amassed over 12.8 million views. Concept photos and video teasers for the song, set to be BTS' second English-language single, were shared through the band's official social media in the weeks following. They held a global press conference one hour after the single's release.BTS appeared as the first guests on Big Hit's new exclusive Melon Station radio series, BigHit Music Record, on May 21 to introduce \"Butter\" and participate in a Q&A with fans. The single impacted American contemporary hit radio stations on May 25. On May 27, Big Hit announced the release of a house bass electro-dance remix of the song, \"Butter (Hotter Remix)\", as a thank-you to fans for their support. The announcement was accompanied by new teaser photos for the remix\u2014seven solo shots and one group\u2014featuring a different concept to the original teasers. The remix and its music video premiered globally on all streaming platforms at midnight on May 28. New remixes succeeded the release of the \"Hotter\" version in the weeks following.The CD single of \"Butter\" includes \"Permission to Dance\", a song written by Ed Sheeran, Johnny McDaid, Steve Mac, and Jenna Andrews and produced by Mac, Stephen Kirk, and Andrews. Released on July 9, it also includes instrumental versions of both songs.Megan Thee Stallion claimed that her label 1501 Certified Entertainment attempted to block the remix release which featured her. Stallion stated that the label's CEO Carl Crawford did not approve of the track because \"it would not be good for her career.\" Stallion sought help from a Texas court. The remix was ultimately released as planned on August 27.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting for NME, Rhian Daly praised \"Butter\" as \"a clean and crisp piece of dance pop that's undeniably cool without sacrificing immediacy or memorable hooks\" and felt it was a strong, early contender for song of the summer. Tom Breihan of Stereogum described the song as \"a full-on retro-disco strutter, a song built for parties. It's a big, slick party song that targets pleasure receptors with mathematical precision\" and compared it to Daft Punk's Random Access Memories and works by Bruno Mars. Zach Seemayer of Entertainment Tonight felt that the song's hook, with its \"truly catchy beat\" and \"fun\" opening lyrics, \"has the hallmarks of a real hit with legitimate song-of-the-summer potential\". Rolling Stone's Althea Legaspi called \"Butter\" a \"feel-good, flirty dance track\". Consequence's Mary Siroky named \"Butter\" the song of the summer and \"a synth-drenched, swaggering track sitting comfortably on an addictive bassline\". Esquire's Dave Holmes called the song \"irresistible\", saying that it \"percolates with the joy we've deferred since last March\". It was named Billboard's number one Song of the Summer. The song was the seventh most searched song of the year for 2021 on Google. For the Megan Thee Stallion remix, Natasha Mulenga, writing for Teen Vogue, described the remix as \"ear-melting\" and that \"Megan gave so much charisma to the song\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\n\n=== Background and synopsis ===\n\nThe music video for \"Butter\" was preceded by a 23-second long video teaser published to Hybe Labels's official YouTube channel on May 18. The short monochromatic clip showed BTS dressed in \"disco-inspired\" suits \"with shoulder pads, glitter, and satin galore\", standing motionless in a line, while \"a groovy percussion ensemble played in the background\". The sound then \"switched to a delightful Eighties-inspired, synth-bass fusion\". The band matched the beat of the \"throbbing, bass-heavy dance groove\" with synchronized head tilts. The clip ended with a shot of a stack of syrup-covered pancakes with a square of butter on top. Billboard described the teaser's \"funky beat\" as \"reminiscent of Queen's 'Another One Bites the Dust'\". Rolling Stone India also noted the teaser's \"strong sonic correlation\" to the Queen song. The video teaser accumulated over 26 million views in its first 24 hours and surpassed 35 million views shortly afterwards.Fifteen minutes prior to the music video's premiere, BTS appeared in a special countdown stream on the Hybe YouTube channel to discuss the song while making buttered sandwiches\u2014it was simultaneously released with the single at midnight EST. The visual opens with a shot of vocalist Jungkook dancing into frame as he sings the introductory lines of the song. Interspersed are \"striking black and white shots\" of the band dressed in \"slick suits\" dancing together to a \"strong percussion ensemble\"\u2014first heard in the May 18 teaser\u2014and standing in a lineup while holding mugshot placards with their names on it. The video then \"transitions into [a] rich and vibrant color palette\" as the band perform \"power-packed\", \"nimble dance moves\" in several \"dazzling locations with soft, full-color lighting...against an array of flamboyant backdrops\" such as a gymnasium (while wearing \"summery gymwear\"), a mock press conference, an elevator, and \"onstage under pulsating lights\" in \"black-and-yellow tuxedos\". The video ends with a shot of J-Hope eating a large piece of butter.The video's choreography \"reflect[s] the upbeat, flirtatious vibe of the song\", with J-hope saying that the band tried to put \"a lot of those emotions\" into it. Signature moves include \"kissing your hands, [giving] a mischievous look, or brushing our hair back\". The video also features a \"TikTok-ready, technicolor elevator sequence\" in which the individual members freestyle their dance moves, including \"putting on imaginary cologne\".

In Germany, \"Butter\" debuted at number seven on the Top 100 Singles chart, becoming the band's highest-charting song and second top-10 in the country\u2014it peaked at number six in July.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\n\nIn an article published by Billboard in August 2021, the magazine pointed out that the band's fans have \"through above-board means\" taken advantage of loopholes in chart tabulations to boost the ranks of singles such as \"Butter\" in the US and help the song top the Hot 100 for multiple weeks. While the chart performance of singles on the Hot 100 typically depend on streaming and airplay, that of \"Butter\" was notably driven mostly by sales (the bulk of which came from BTS' webstore, which allows fans to buy multiple copies of a song, unlike iTunes) and by fan-led crowdfunding efforts (including using money collected from fans worldwide on services like PayPal to make purchases that count toward US sales only). However, an article in The Korea Times pushed back against claims of chart manipulation. It opined that fanbases of other artists such as Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande have employed similar promotional measures, that such measures were neither illegal or unethical, and that fans engaging in those measures were merely \"intelligent consumers leading global trends\".\n\n\n== Live performances ==\n\nBTS gave the premiere performance of \"Butter\" live from South Korea for the 2021 Billboard Music Awards on May 23. Dressed in \"slick\" black tuxedos, the band sang the song while moving through various elaborate sets\u2014a backstage dressing-room area, a soundstage, and replicas of the BBMAs red carpet and stage\u2014accompanied by \"pinpoint choreography\" that featured \"finely manicured\" dance moves and an \"explosive routine\" during the song's instrumental break. The performance ended with the band \"smiling and shining in front of a wall of lights\". BTS performed the song later that night on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, this time appearing in \"a grand ballroom, fitted out with glorious chandeliers and art deco features, and raining with gold glitter\". The band was the first musical act in the lineup for Good Morning America's 2021 Summer Concert Series, appearing on the May 29 episode, where they performed the track as part of a two-song set that also included \"Dynamite\". They performed both songs again on July 1, at Sirius XM Hits 1. In 2022, BTS performed the song at the 64th Grammy Awards on April 3.The televised world premiere performance of the remix with Megan Thee Stallion was initially scheduled for the 2021 American Music Awards. The rapper later withdrew her appearance at the show, citing personal reasons, and BTS performed the original version of the song instead. The following week, she made a surprise appearance during the second night of the band's four-day concert series at SoFi Stadium and performed the remix together with them for the first time.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Melon and Tidal.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Certifications and sales ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== Cover version ==\nBillboard magazine reported that the a cappella group Pentatonix performed a cover the song in a mash-up of \"Butter\" and \"Dynamite\" released in August 2021.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Drivers License\" (stylized in all lowercase) is the debut single by American singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo. It was released on January 8, 2021, through Geffen and Interscope Records, as the lead single from her debut studio album, Sour (2021). She co-wrote the song with its producer Dan Nigro. Containing poignant lyrics detailing heartache, \"Drivers License\" is a power ballad blending bedroom pop, indie pop, and power pop styles. It is characterized by a minimalist, piano-led production, incorporating kick drums, harmonies, syncopated hand-claps, and a dreamy bridge. One of 2021's most successful songs, \"Drivers License\" launched Rodrigo's music career.\nThe song documents the \"multifaceted\" emotions Rodrigo endured after a heartbreak. She teased the song on her social media for many months in 2020, before announcing it on January 4, 2021. The official music video was posted to YouTube alongside the song's release, in which Rodrigo drives around a suburban area after receiving her driver's license and reminisces about her memories of the song's subject, who encouraged her to obtain the license. \"Drivers License\" was met with widespread critical acclaim; praise centered on Rodrigo's cathartic songwriting, emotional vocals, and the song's stirring production, with many underscoring its Taylor Swift and Lorde influences. The song won Best Pop Solo Performance at the 2022 Grammy Awards, where it was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\"Drivers License\" broke a string of records, including the Spotify record for the most single-day streams for a non-holiday song (achieved on its fourth day of release), the biggest first-week for a song on Spotify and Amazon Music. The song topped the US Billboard Hot 100 and made Rodrigo the youngest artist ever to debut atop the chart. The song spent eight consecutive weeks at number one. It has been certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elsewhere, \"Drivers License\" reached number one in 25 countries, as well as spending multiple weeks atop the charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. It also peaked within the top ten in Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and various others. As of August 11, 2021, the song has over 1 billion streams on Spotify, ranking amongst the 100 most streamed songs of the platform.",

It also peaked within the top ten in Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and various others. As of August 11, 2021, the song has over 1 billion streams on Spotify, ranking amongst the 100 most streamed songs of the platform.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nAmerican singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo currently stars in the 2019 Disney+ mockumentary series, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. She contributed a self-written song called \"All I Want\" to the soundtrack, which was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for earning over 500,000 units in the United States. The series was renewed for a second season in 2021. Rodrigo signed to Geffen Records, a subsidiary of Interscope Records, intending to release her debut EP in 2021.\nWhen I came up with 'Drivers License', I was going through a heartbreak that was so confusing to me, so multifaceted. Putting all those feelings into a song made everything seem so much simpler and clearer\u2014and at the end of the day, I think that's the whole purpose of songwriting. There\u2019s nothing like sitting at the piano in my bedroom and writing a really sad song. It\u2019s truly my favorite thing in the world.\nShe teased the song for many months in 2020, including some lyrics on Instagram. She posted a snippet, captioned \"Wrote dis the other day. vv close to my heart. gonna call it drivers license I think lol\", where she plays the song on a piano. The song was announced on January 4. The song was released to all digital music and streaming platforms four days later, alongside a music video on YouTube. It is the lead single to her debut studio album Sour, which Rodrigo had originally planned to be an EP. \"Drivers License\" impacted US contemporary hit radio on January 19.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nSteered by piano, \"Drivers License\" is an atmospheric power ballad, that has been described as a bedroom pop, indie pop, and power pop song, with elements of folk and indie rock. It was inspired by the disorienting emotions Rodrigo felt after a recent breakup. She wrote the song with its producer, Daniel Nigro. The song is written in the key of B\u266d major and has a fast tempo of 144 beats per minute, with double time kick drum and claps on the second  verse and lead-in. Rodrigo's vocal range on the song spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of F5. Lyrically, the song has Rodrigo drive through a suburban area, upset and angry, pondering whether any of the subject's feelings were ever true.The song begins with the sound of Rodrigo's mother's car engine starting, followed by a \"door ajar\" chime that fades into a pulsing piano key. Rodrigo delivers soprano vocals that grow into \"cathartic howls of pain\" as the song progresses, along with a swelling crescendo followed by an emotional chorus. The minimalist instrumentation also consists of syncopated hand-claps and stomping harmonies, and reaches its peak in a rich bridge of layered vocals with the catchphrase \"I still fuckin' love you\". As stated by Rodrigo, the song has Lorde and Taylor Swift influences, which was also noted by critics. Rodrigo also stated that the EP Minor (2020) by American singer-songwriter Gracie Abrams inspired the musical style of \"Drivers License\".In an interview with Vogue magazine, Rodrigo acknowledged the song had grammatical errors, including the lack of an apostrophe (\"Drivers License\" vs \"Driver's License\") and the contradictory double negative: \"I've never felt this way for no one\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Drivers License\" received universal acclaim from critics upon its release. Clash critic Robin Murray dubbed the song a \"sensational pop statement, an impeccable melodic moment right from the off\". He praised its firm songwriting and atmospheric production. Matthew Kent, writing for The Line of Best Fit, complimented the song's euphoric sound and poignant lyricism, and asserted that the single is packed with \"emotional punch after emotional punch\". They dubbed the song a \"stunning\" and \"stirring\" debut single. Kelsie Gibson of PopSugar opined that the song gives off \"major Lorde and Taylor Swift\" influences, who are two of Rodrigo's musical inspirations. Stereogum critic Chris DeVille described \"Drivers License\" as a cinematic and old-fashioned power ballad, a \"prime Spotify-core sadgirl fare\" that starts \"as a trembling Phoebe Bridgers song\" and concludes as a \"resplendent Folklore track\".Listing it amongst best new music, Teen Vogue's Claire Dodson commented that Rodrigo employs soaring vocals, and capture \"small details\" in the song. Dodson thought the song channels \"the songwriting prowess she already brings to the table\". Naming it one of the \"10 Cool New Pop Songs to Get You Through The Week\", Billboard writers Gab Linsberg and Jason Lipshutz branded \"Drivers License\" the type of debut single \"that aspiring artists dream of\", where Rodrigo perfects her heartbreak's \"fragility and heightened emotion\". They commended the singer's range in the song, swinging between the crescendo's \"stomp-clap harmonies\" and the bridge's \"choked-up balladry\". Ellise Shafer of Variety found the song relatable and vulnerable, and complimented its production and vocal performance. Shafer noted it as \"a must-hear for any pop enthusiast\".Calling the song an \"early contender for song of the year\", Rolling Stone critic Brittany Spanos noted that the production of \"Drivers License\" is reminiscent of Lorde's Melodrama (2017), while the lyrics and \"detailed\" storytelling channel Swift's Fearless (2008). Spanos lauded Rodrigo's songwriting skills and emotional potency at age 17, and added that \"she could likely become pop's next great raconteur\". Justin Curto of Vulture opined that \"Drivers License\" mixes \"the intimate arrangements of Folklore and Evermore with the high stakes pop of Lover, tying it all together with a dramatic, Swiftian bridge\". He also added that Rodrigo's calm vocals sound like Billie Eilish, while her anthemic moments recall Lorde, with hints of Alessia Cara. Jared Richards of Junkee stated that the song has \"an irreducible quality, capturing a very specific heartbreak\", blending \"the slow-build piano-belters and bridge breakdowns of Lorde's Melodrama with Swiftian songwriting\", and regarded it 2021's \"Big Pop Moment\".In May 2021, Billboard ranked \"Drivers License\" third on their ranking of the \"100 Greatest Song Bridges of the 21st Century\", and in June 2021, they ranked the song as the best song of 2021 so far, with Rania Aniftos calling the song \"the start of Rodrigo's reign as pop's most captivating new storyteller\".\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Drivers License\" was met with widespread commercial success worldwide, with publications calling it the year's biggest hit in early 2021. Upon release, the song reached number one on international Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music songs charts. Billboard reported that, in its first three days in the US, the song sold over 16,000 digital downloads and received more than 21 million streams. Compared to its release day, the song's total streams increased by 122% on its second day, and rose another 32% in its third day.The song broke the Spotify record for most one-day streams for a non-holiday song, with over 15 million global streams on its fourth day (January 11, 2021). The next day, it extended its record with over 17 million streams.

It also broke the record for the biggest global first-week streams for a song in Amazon Music history, and became the most requested song of a single day on Alexa.\"Drivers License\" also reached number one on both Billboard Global and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts, generating 130 million streams and 49,000 sales with the former, and 54.5 million streams and 12,000 sales on the latter. It marked the highest weekly streaming total in the world for a song by a female artist, with 130.06 million streams, surpassing the 130.042 million sum for Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\". The song topped both the global charts for three consecutive weeks, becoming the first song by a female artist to do so ever since the charts' inauguration, and the second overall after \"D\u00e1kiti\" (2020) by Bad Bunny and Jhay Cortez. It stayed atop both the charts for eight consecutive weeks.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\"Drivers License\" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, giving Rodrigo her first number-one single in the United States, and making her the first female artist since Carrie Underwood to have their first single debut at number-one on the chart. It marked her second entry on the chart, after \"All I Want\". It collected 76.1 million streams, 38,000 digital downloads, and 8.1 million airplay impressions in its opening week. Surpassing Jawsh 685, who topped the chart with \"Savage Love (Laxed - Siren Beat)\" (2020), Rodrigo became the most-recently-born artist to top the Hot 100, and the youngest since Billie Eilish, who achieved it with \"Bad Guy\" (2019), and is the youngest artist ever to debut atop the Hot 100. \"Drivers License\" topped the Billboard Streaming Songs and Digital Song Sales charts as well, staying atop both for three consecutive weeks. Billboard noted the song as one of the most dominant number-one hits of all time, garnering more than double the Hot 100 units of its closest competitor, \"Mood\" (2020). \"Drivers License\" spent eight consecutive weeks atop the Hot 100; it became the seventh single in the chart's history to have debuted at number one and spend at least its first eight weeks at the spot.As of July 2021, \"Drivers License\" was the most streamed song of 2021 so far, with 582.8 million on-demand streams.

The song broke the record for highest single-day streams in British history for a non-Christmas song, surpassing the previous record held by Ed Sheeran's \"Shape of You\" (2017).

Spurred by \"Drivers License\", \"All I Want\" reached number 32, marking her second top-40 entry in the UK.In Ireland, \"Drivers License\" debuted at the top of the Irish Singles Chart. It was the country's most downloaded and streamed song its first two weeks, outperforming the rest of the top five combined. It has so far remained at number one for nine consecutive weeks; \"All I Want\" charted simultaneously, reaching a new peak of number 16.In Australia, \"Drivers License\" debuted at the top of the ARIA Singles Chart dated January 24, 2021, scoring Rodrigo her first number one song in Australia. In doing so, the song became the first debut single to top the ARIA Singles Chart since Harry Styles' \"Sign of the Times\" in 2017. \"Drivers License\" spent six consecutive weeks atop the chart.\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\nThe video, directed by Matthew Dillon Cohen, adopts a vignette aesthetic and depicts Rodrigo's healing from heartbreak. She receives her driver's license in the video, but instead of going to her old lover's house like she used to dream of, she finds herself aimlessly cruising suburban side streets. Rodrigo reminisces about moments from her brief relationship. At the beginning of the video, she is embraced by the happy memories only, but eventually, all the toxic traits of her ex-partner confront her. The video received positive comments from critics for its visuals.As of March 2022, the song has 350 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nWhen we were talking about the audience that [Rodrigo] had prior to the release\u2014that's a very young, female, engaged audience. So they really sort of sparked the flame. But now what you have is it traveling well beyond that audience. And obviously social media platforms have helped that, but I think just word of mouth. This is a song you're talking about with everyone right now. Everyone's listening to it, everyone's obsessing over it.\n\"Drivers License\" has been credited with launching Rodrigo's music career. The instant commercial success of the song upon its release has been attributed to the rise of niche market for bedroom pop, the song's emotional lyricism and appeal, TikTok, the tabloid journalism and social media speculation surrounding the song, and Rodrigo's Disney career. The Indian Express opined that song is a part of the DIY movement in the music industry, where young artists (mostly post-millennials), such as Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, and Tate McRae, are capable of making music of \"near-studio quality\" without leaving the house. Commenting on the song's unprecedented success, Spotify's Becky Bass stated that \"We've never seen anything like this, where you do have a newer artist that just comes out of the gate in such a dominant way, and just continues to grow\".Paper remarked that the song is a \"product of years of pop trends\" that resonates with millions of listeners, similar to the rise of Eilish in 2019, Lorde in 2013, or Taylor Swift in the late 2000s, but occurred instantly in Rodrigo's case, because of recent technological innovations like TikTok that has altered the course of the music industry. The TikTok hashtag \"#driverslicense\" amassed over 888.5 million views in one week. Paper also highlighted consumers' interest in the song's romantic background (a phenomenon of listeners being invested in the drama between Disney co-stars) as a factor for the song's success. The New York Times writer Joe Coscarelli wrote that the song was spurred not only by its quality, but also the gossips surrounding it, paired with the label's marketing plan, and support from celebrities like Swift. He noted the autobiographical song bolstered tabloids and listeners to \"piece together its real-life parallels\", while TikTok videos led to social media posts, \"which led to streams, which led to news articles, and back around again\", generating an \"unbeatable\" feedback loop. Coscarelli added that, similar to Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, and Selena Gomez, Rodrigo took \"her experiences within the Disney machine and attempted to translate them for a broader, more adult audience\".Stereogum's Chris DeVille found Rodrigo to be an example of \"actor-turned-pop stars\" who profit off their best-known roles, such as her Bizaardvark and High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, which \"created a massive built-in audience for a prospective Rodrigo music career\"; \"Drivers License\" maximized this interest by referencing the \"behind-the-scenes drama\" involving Joshua Bassett, who co-stars with Rodrigo in High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, and Sabrina Carpenter. DeVille added that the song \"will have ripple effects\" that affect the industry in 2021 and beyond, as its bedroom pop sound is challenging hip-hop's dominance on streaming platforms. Douglas Greenwood, writing for I-D, asserted that \"Drivers License\" contains \"all of the old-school ingredients of a hit\".Insider dubbed the song an \"early 2021 cultural touchstone\", citing its \"sad girl appeal\" echoing Generation Z (similar to Lorde and Eilish), the celebrity romance associated with its lyrics (like that of Swift), the song's cinematic bridge, its TikTok popularity, and radio friendliness as contributing factors to the song's success. Music journalist Laura Snapes, writing for The Guardian, wrote \"Drivers License\" is the \"epitome of new-school pop songwriting\", in which power ballads are sonically intimate and subdued, rather than bombastic, with lyrics delving into specific and complex emotions. The February 20, 2021 episode of Saturday Night Live included a skit in which English actor Reg\u00e9-Jean Page and six other male cast members recited the song's lyrics. Responding to the tabloid speculation around the song's subjects, Rodrigo stated: \"I put it out not knowing that it would get that reaction, so it was really strange [when] it did. I just remember [everyone being] so weird and speculative about stuff they had no idea about. I don't really subscribe to hating other women because of boys. I think that's so stupid, and I really resent that narrative that was being tossed around.\"\"Drivers License\" was featured as the main music for Google's Year in Search commercial for 2021.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nCD single\"Drivers License\" \u2013 4:04\n\"Drivers License\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:48\n\"Drivers License\" (instrumental) \u2013 4:02\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Sour.Studio locations\n\nPersonnel\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Good 4 U\" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo, released on May 14, 2021, through Geffen and Interscope Records, as the third single from Rodrigo's debut studio album, Sour (2021).

At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, \"Good 4 U\" received a nomination for Best Music Video.\nThe single reached number one in 23 countries including Australia, Germany, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States; it was the second chart-topping single from Sour in many of those countries, following Rodrigo's debut single \"Drivers License\" (2021). \"Good 4 U\" peaked within the top 10 in more than 20 territories. It has received platinum or multi-platinum certifications globally.\n\n\n== Background and development ==\nRodrigo announced her debut studio album Sour on April 1, 2021. \"Good 4 U\" placed sixth on the track listing. On May 10, Rodrigo announced via her social media accounts that \"Good 4 U\" would become the third single from Sour on May 14, following \"Drivers License\" and \"Deja Vu\". Alongside the announcement, she also revealed the song's cover artwork. Rodrigo had previously teased the song in a promotional image for \"Deja Vu\".In her August 2021 Variety cover story, Rodrigo stated she came up with the song's hook in the shower. She added she did not want the entirety of Sour to be \"sad piano songs\", but also did not want to write a happy, \"I'm in love\" pop song, because \"that was so far from how [she] was truly feeling at the time\". Rodrigo concluded that \"Good 4 U\" was \"really satisfying\" due to its upbeat energy and danceability without sacrificing honesty and authenticity in her lyrics.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\n\n\"Good 4 U\" is an electro-tinged rock, pop-punk, pop rock, grunge, teen pop, and an emo song with alternative influences. Its instrumentation is driven by a set of 1990s-inspired electric guitars and bass. Its verses follow a rhythm typical of R&B. The song was written by Rodrigo and Daniel Nigro, and produced by Nigro and Alexander 23. In August 2021, Paramore members Hayley Williams and Josh Farro received writing credits, as the chorus was inspired by Paramore's 2007 song \"Misery Business\". This proved to be controversial as many disputed the plagiarism claim, citing them as being two completely different songs with some similarities. Rodrigo later responded, discussing her feelings about Williams and Farro being added as co-writers on \"Good 4 U\":\n\n\"I think it's disappointing to see people take things out of context and discredit any young woman's work. But at the end of the day, I'm just really proud and happy to say that my job is being a songwriter. All music is inspired by each other. Obviously, I write all of my lyrics from my heart and my life first. I came up with the lyrics and the melody for 'Good 4 U' one morning in the shower. What's so beautiful about music is that it can be so inspired by music that's come out in the past. Every single artist is inspired by artists who have come before them. It's sort of a fun, beautiful sharing process. Nothing in music is ever new. There's four chords in every song. That's the fun part \u2014 trying to make that your own.\"\nThe song begins with an \"uncluttered five-note\" staccato bass line and Rodrigo's vocals delivered in a soft tone, which is then joined by an energetic guitar, using a chorus effect, before dropping into the drums-driven chorus. The second verse returns to the original bass line with added \"lilting\" drum beats and backup harmonies, and slowly ascends to Rodrigo's \"near-shout\" vocal delivery.In \"Good 4 U,\" Rodrigo confronts her ex who has moved on very quickly from the relationship with her, using plentiful sarcastic remarks and singing, \"Well, good for you / You look happy and healthy, not me / If you ever cared to ask / Good for you / You're doin' great out there without me, baby / God, I wish that I could do that / I've lost my mind, I've spent the night / Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom / But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it / But I guess good for you.\" It marks a departure from Rodrigo's preceding singles, \"Drivers License\" and \"Deja Vu\", which presented a melancholic and slower emotion.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Good 4 U\" received positive reviews from music critics. People's Tom\u00e1s Mier has described the song as a \"heartbreak track filled with an angsty pop-rock sound.\" Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone lauded Rodrigo's musical versatility, and noted influences from Taylor Swift in \"Good 4 U\". Variety critic Ellise Shaffer dubbed the song a \"nostalgic heartbreak anthem\" evoking a \"fluttering, cathartic feeling reminiscent of late '90s Hole or early Paramore, but with a poppier flair\". Teen Vogue's Claire Dodson said that \"Good 4 U\" gives \"pure 2000s pop-punk\" aside Rodrigo's \"knockout songwriting\". Dodson found Rodrigo's voice versatile, easily moving between styles similar to Swift's vocals in \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" (2012), and that of Alanis Morissette and Hayley Williams, to become \"something original\". Sydney Bucksbaum, writing for Entertainment Weekly, called the single a \"pop-punk breakup anthem\" and an \"immediate banger\", underlining the song's similarities to Paramore's \"Misery Business\" (2007). In agreement, Halle Kiefer of Vulture also named the song an \"angry track\" evocative of \"Misery Business\" in \"the best possible way\". In a critique of its genre, Slate's Chris Molanphy said \"Good 4 U\" is a \"snarling rock number\" inspired by the 2000s, adding that it \"not really rock-slash-anything. It isn't alt-rock crossed with SoundCloud rap like the recent chart-topper 'Mood' by 24kGoldn and Iann Dior, isn't guitar-based trap-pop \u00e0 la Post Malone, isn't indie-rock with bedroom-pop hooks \u00e0 la Taylor Swift's recent creations.\"\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, \"Good 4 U\" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, giving Rodrigo her second number-one song in the country, following her eight-week chart-topper \"Drivers License\".

The song drew 43.2 million U.S. streams and sold 12,000 downloads in its first week of release. The track debuted atop the Streaming Songs chart as Rodrigo's second leader and ruling for seven consecutive weeks, after \"Drivers License\" ruled for four weeks, and started at number five on the Billboard Digital Songs chart. \"Good 4 U\" dropped to number two in its second week and held that rank for eleven non-consecutive weeks, becoming the first song since Whitney Houston's \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" (1995\u201396) to spend eleven weeks at number two on the Hot 100.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Good 4 U\" was also a commercial success.

It topped the charts for five consecutive weeks, in the fourth of which it became the first rock song to reach such a feat since Evanescence's \"Bring Me to Life\" (2003). In its seventh week, the song was dethroned by Ed Sheeran's \"Bad Habits\" dropping down to number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. After ten weeks within the top ten on the UK Charts, \"Good 4 U\" dropped out of the top ten charting at number 12. \"Good 4 U\" spent a total of 25 weeks inside the UK Top 40 in 2021.

With this, all singles from Sour had entered the top 10 of the chart. The song spent five consecutive weeks at number one in Ireland. \"Good 4 U\" further topped the singles chart in New Zealand and Singapore. In Australia, \"Good 4 U\" debuted at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart, after which it rose to number one upon the impact of Sour. \"Good 4 U\" spent six consecutive weeks at number one in Australia.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nBritish rock magazine Kerrang! stated that \"Good 4 U\" leads the commercial comeback of rock music in 2020\u20132021, noting how it is the first rock record since Evanescence's 2003 single \"Bring Me to Life\" to spend four or more weeks atop the UK Singles chart, alongside chart success of other rock-adjacent artists, such as Willow Smith, Machine Gun Kelly, M\u00e5neskin, and Miley Cyrus. Slate admired Rodrigo's versatility and proclaimed that she \"might be the dying genre's best hope\", pinpointing that \"Good 4 U\" is the \"most up-the-middle rock song to top the [U.S.] Hot 100 in a decade or more\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\nAn accompanying music video directed by Petra Collins was released alongside the song on May 14, 2021. The music video references horror films such as Audition (1999) and Jennifer's Body (2009). Rodrigo was styled by vlogger Devon Carlson for the video. In the video, Rodrigo appears in a variety of looks, including a cheerleading uniform seen in 2001 coming-of-age film The Princess Diaries (also seen in the cover artwork). She plays the role of a high schooler out for revenge, destroying her ex-boyfriend's bedroom and lighting his belongings on fire. Insider critic Callie Ahlgrim opined that the fire was a reference to Swift's music video for \"Picture to Burn\" (2008), which also follows a similar revengeful concept.As of March 2022, the song has 350 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nRodrigo performed \"Good 4 U\" for the first time on May 15, 2021, along with \"Drivers License\", on Saturday Night Live.

Following his performance with Bring Me the Horizon at the 2022 BRIT Awards, the pair announced they were releasing a hard rock studio version of the track on 17 February 2022.\n\n\n== Background ==\nA slower acoustic song was planned to be released as the lead single from Sheeran's upcoming fifth studio album =. However, when the easing of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were announced in England in early 2021, Sheeran chose to record \"Bad Habits\" and release it instead. \"I was like, 'I don't know if the world needs a depressing sad, slow acoustic song when [the country is] opening up'\", Sheeran said. He wrote the song in January 2021 to \"surprise people\" and \"make something that was totally different\" to what is expected of him.\n\n\n== Release ==\nOn 23 April 2021, Sheeran was spotted dressed as a zombie or vampire on a music video set in London, leading to speculations about upcoming music. Sheeran himself confirmed the pictures to be genuine by posting outtakes of the video shoot on his social media pages in June 2021. On 25 May, he uploaded a picture of himself sitting next to a giant Snorlax pillow, with a caption on the picture above him saying \"6/25\", hinting at a release on that date. On 4 June, he began teasing the single release on his social media accounts, as well as announcing a performance at TikTok's UEFA Euro 2020 show with David Beckham on 25 June. Sheeran announced the single on 11 June. A promotional image of the single cover appeared on the Tate Modern in London.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Bad Habits\" was met with mixed reviews from critics. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the song four out of five stars, describing it as \"a certain smash that's ready for the Weeknd\". Nick Levine of NME gave the track three out of five stars, calling it \"neither a misfire nor a surefire winner,\" and compared the sound style to Bronski Beat works, especially \"Smalltown Boy\". The Independent's Adam White was less impressed, giving \"the stilted comeback\" two out of five stars and saying Sheeran was \"letting the toplines do the work and rummaging through Abel Tesfaye's leftovers.\" Quinn Moreland of Pitchfork derided the song as \"painfully predictable\", writing that it \"aspires for Abel but settles for anonymity\". MetalSucks called the version featuring Bring Me the Horizon an attempt to combine metal with pop, but that it came off sounding like an Imagine Dragons song.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nIn the United States, \"Bad Habits\" debuted at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, with 38.8 million airplay audience impressions, 17.7 million streams and 33,200 copies sold. It opened at number two on Digital Song Sales and number six on Streaming Songs, and surged 36\u201311 on Radio Songs. The song became Sheeran's eighth top 10 in the US and first since 2019. On the chart dated 28 August 2021, the song reached a new peak at number two behind \"Stay\" by The Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber. The song ranked at number one on the Top Triller US Chart dated to 10 July 2021. The chart highlights the biggest songs on Triller based on a formula blending the amount of views of videos containing a respective songs, the level of engagement with those videos and the raw total of videos uploaded featuring each song.\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\nThe music video for \"Bad Habits\" was directed by Dave Meyers and filmed at the Catford Centre in Catford, South East London. It was uploaded on 25 June 2021, onto YouTube where it has over 200 million views as of 29 October 2021. The music video portrays Sheeran as a vampire in a hot pink suit. The video starts in a beauty salon with Sheeran as a vampire, withering a flower before flying across the chaos-ridden streets. He joins with several other monsters in doing various activities amidst the panicking crowd, including attacking them for the fun of it and handing out a balloon to a monster child, until the sun begins to rise. Most of the monsters go into hiding, with a few vaporized by the sunlight, except for Sheeran, who transforms back into his normal human self, playing the guitar as the video ends. The black cat in the video is a reference to the Catford Cat at the entrance to the shopping Centre. The video concept received comparisons to Michael Jackson's Thriller.Sheeran said he wanted the video to \"play on the nature of habits in a fantastical way so I decided on vampires.\" It was inspired by the song's lyrics and American television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Madison Bloom of Pitchfork described Sheeran as \"the worst monster in the history of pop music\", pointing out that the video \"constantly suggests the potential for violence and gore but never commits.\"\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nSheeran gave his first live performance of \"Bad Habits\" on 28 June 2021, on The Late Late Show with James Corden. On 30 June, Sheeran performed the song on The One Show. Sheeran performed the song on GMA Network's All-Out Sundays on 15 August.At the 2022 Brit Awards, Sheeran performed \"Bad Habits\" with Bring Me the Horizon.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nEd Sheeran \u2013 vocals, songwriting, production, acoustic guitar, percussion\nFred Gibson \u2013 songwriting, production, backing vocals, bass, drums, guitar, keyboards, piano, programming, engineering\nJohnny McDaid \u2013 songwriting, production, acoustic guitar, engineering\nGraham Archer \u2013 vocal production, engineering\nIain Archer \u2013 slide guitar\nWill Reynolds \u2013 engineering assistance\nMark \"Spike\" Stent \u2013 mixing\nMatt Wolach \u2013 mixing assistance\nStuart Hawkes \u2013 mastering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Billboard Adult Contemporary number ones of 2021\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBad Habits on YouTube\nBad Habits [Official Lyric Video] on YouTube\nBad Habits [Meduza Remix] on YouTube\nBad Habits [Official Acoustic Video] on YouTube\nBad Habits [Official Behind the Scenes Video] on YouTube\nBad Habits [Studio BTS] on YouTube\nBad Habits (Comic Book Video) on YouTube",

It was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. \n\n\n== Background ==\nIn early January 2021, Doja Cat revealed that her upcoming studio album features numerous guest appearances, including SZA. On March 5, 2021, the song was first mentioned by SZA in an interview with V. About the song, SZA revealed that it \"is a different strut and I'm just excited\", while Doja Cat replied by praising SZA, saying \"I commend artists, like you, who stick to something\". On April 8, 2021, Doja Cat took to social media to reveal the cover art and announce the release of the song for April 9. In an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, Doja Cat said: \"I wanted to make a song about kissing. I just thought it would be cute. That doesn't happen too often, but just a song that's solely about kissing.\"\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Kiss Me More\" is a pop, pop rap, bubblegum pop, dance-pop and R&B song largely influenced by disco. It is composed in 44 time and the key of A-flat major, with a moderately fast tempo of 111 beats per minute (BPM) and a chord progression of B\u266dm7\u2013E\u266d7\u2013A\u266dmaj7\u2013D\u266dmaj7. Doja Cat opens the song with vocals that recall \"the gentle airiness of a light breeze\", before two crashes of cymbals \"act like glue\" as they precede the beat drop. The song is \"bolstered\" by a \"sunny, glimmering riff\" and both singing and rap verses which critics noted to spotlight Doja Cat as equal parts singer and rapper. It is distinguishable by its slightly distorted signature guitar lead. Lyrical themes include \"romance, passion, bold sexual desires, and tenderness all at once\". The song's chorus interpolates the melody from Olivia Newton-John's \"Physical\", to which songwriters Steve Kipner and Terry Shaddick are also credited as co-writers.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nSome critics drew resemblance between the song and Doja Cat's breakthrough 2020 hit \"Say So\". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that it \"mixes the breeze of lite 1980s funk with the bawdiness of 2020s hip-hop, a juggling act that Doja Cat has pioneered, if not trademarked, by now.\" Justin Cutro of Vulture described it as \"a silky, playful R&B jam\", while writers at Rolling Stone deemed it a \"groovy, disco-inflected jam\".  Heran Mamo of Billboard wrote that \"the slinky, sensual jam will definitely be a summer playlist staple with its groovy bass line\". Writing for Nylon, Steffanee Wang described the song as \"a mid-tempo pop number with guitar and sticky melodies\". Writing for Teen Vogue, Claire Dodson described the song as \"excellent\" and \"a shimmering ode to kissing [...] with a somewhat melancholy underlying melody that contrasts well with that signature soft-disco Doja beat.\" Anders Hare of Rated R&B wrote that the \"sunkissed, bouncy tune [...] features both musical prowesses sensually crooning about embracing the now with their significant others.\" Doja Cat and SZA's vocals were described as \"smooth\", \"sultry\" and \"evocative\". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard praised the duo's delivery and noted that they \"keep their rhymes tight and chorus vocals breathy, but don't mince words\". Both the song and its accompanying music video received all-round praise for its dreaminess and sensuality.Complex ranked \"Kiss Me More\" seventh on its mid-year list of the best songs of 2021 and named it one of the most \"infectious\" songs of the year. Describing it as \"light and uptempo\" and deeming it \"a masterclass in disco-adjacent pop music\", they praised Doja Cat's \"terrific job balancing singing and rapping over a catchy riff\" with her \"snappy flow\" and \"tongue-in-cheek punchlines\". Insider crowned \"Kiss Me More\" the best song on Planet Her and hailed it as \"easily one of the best songs released [in 2021]\" since \"every moment of this song is disarming and brilliant.\" Brandon Yu of Mic deemed it \"the most refined showcase of her many talents thus far\". In an album review for Consequence, Carys Anderson agreed that the song \"sums up every layer of Doja Cat\u2019s complex celebrity\" with its infectious guitar line and chanted refrain, ultimately making it \"a summery summation\" of the \"hyper-feminine, hyper-sexual, hyper-futuristic aesthetic\" of Planet Her.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\n\"Kiss Me More\" appeared on many mid-year best-of lists, with several critics identifying it as one best songs of the year so far. The following is a selected list of publications.\n\n\n=== Industry awards ===\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\nThe music video was filmed in March 2021, directed by Warren Fu. It premiered the same day as the single. It features an astronaut (played by American actor Alex Landi) who crash-lands and explores the fictional \"Planet Her\", where Doja Cat and SZA portray seductive aliens who \"provide soulful ambiance to his journey.\" At the end, he wakes up in a glass tube displayed among a collection of other men who have tried to explore the planet before him.Emlyn Travis of MTV praised the music video, describing Planet Her as \"a mysterious, flourishing world filled with glittering oases, calming zen gardens, pastel sunset skies, and blossoming cherry trees that is ruled by two larger-than-life queens\". Meaghan Garvey of Billboard noted that the video is \"bathed in pastel hues and high-femme futurism, and while it's over-the-top sexy, it still ends with Doja and SZA cracking each other up while playing a video game in a galaxy far, far away. \" Erica Gonzales of Harper's Bazaar described the video as a \"fantastical\" one that \"only their creative minds could pull off.\" Jem Aswad of Variety deemed it \"trippy\", while Jackson Langford of NME described it as \"sensual sci-fi\". Mekishana Pierre of Entertainment Tonight noted that it was \"as playful and sugary-sweet as the track itself\". Trishna Rikhy of V wrote: \"A celestial visual and sonic experience, the hints of surrealism Doja Cat constantly threads through her videos still lingers\". John Wohlmacher of Beats Per Minute noted that the fact that these \"playful goddesses\" were more interested in videogames than men shows just how clever the thematic approach to Planet Her was.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nDoja Cat performed a solo version of \"Kiss Me More\" for the first time at Triller's inaugural Fight Club event in April 2021. Doja Cat and SZA performed the song together at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards in May 2021. Doja Cat again performed a solo version of the song within a medley at the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Awards later that month. During a solo virtual concert as part of American Express's \"Unstaged\" campaign, SZA performed her verse from the song as well as the chorus usually sung by Doja Cat. She performed it in the same manner during a solo virtual concert as part of Grey Goose's \"In Dream\" campaign.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal and the Planet Her liner notes.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Industry Baby\" (stylized in uppercase) is a song by American rappers Lil Nas X and Jack Harlow, released on July 23, 2021, through Columbia Records. The song features co-production by American rapper and record producer Kanye West and production duo Take a Daytrip. It is the third single from Lil Nas X's debut studio album, Montero (2021), following up the international success of lead single \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\". The song debuted at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week of August 7, 2021, and became Lil Nas X's third and Harlow's first number-one single on the chart on the week of October 23, 2021. On October 9, 2021, an extended version was released that features a short verse from Lil Nas X during the outro.\nThe song received a nomination for Best Melodic Rap Performance at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\n\nIn March 2021, Nike, Inc. filed a lawsuit against the art collective MSCHF, who designed the Satan Shoes as promotion for Lil Nas X's song, \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\". The case was settled in April, though on July 16, Lil Nas X posted a video on TikTok claiming that he had an upcoming court hearing regarding it on July 19. The date of this supposed court hearing, however, turned out to be the release date of the teaser for \"Industry Baby\" in the form of a skit parodying the lawsuit, with him ostensibly appearing on trial for the Satan Shoes, but quickly shifting focus towards his sexuality. The teaser was accompanied by a website.In late June, a demo version of the song with slightly different instrumentals was leaked online. The demo version included no features.Ahead of the song's release, Lil Nas X shared a letter addressed to his 20-year-old self noting that the song is one \"for us\". Among other things, he writes of his stagnation during the COVID-19 pandemic, ostracization due to his sexuality, and staying strong in the face of adversity to witness his future success.Alongside the release of the song and music video on July 23, 2021, Lil Nas X also partnered with the non-profit organization The Bail Project through the Bail X Fund, raising money with the goal of ending cash bail in the United States in mind.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nClash described the song \"as a bubbling piece of pop-edged rap.\" Billboard described the song as an \"expertly crafted rap anthem.\" The song is written in the key of E-flat minor, using a iv-V-i chord progression. It was originally planned to feature a guest appearance from Nicki Minaj; however, Lil Nas X did not receive a response from her.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Music video ==\nTaking place within the fictitious Montero State Prison, the music video for \"Industry Baby\" continues after the teaser video where Lil Nas X is sentenced to five years in prison for being gay. The video pays homage to the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption and the 1979 film Escape from Alcatraz. The dancing was choreographed by Sean Bankhead.The video was directed by Christian Breslauer and produced by Andrew Lerios based on a story by Lil Nas X. Other credits include Luis Caraza as the video editor and Bryson Pintard as the art director. The video starred Lil Nas X, Jack Harlow and Colton Haynes as Head of security and Vanessa Buchholz as a prison guard. Jason Mamoa lookalike Phil Brandt is also visible in the prison yard. The video incorporated 20 dancers, 9 \"prison guards\" and 29 \"prisoners\".Five days later, on July 28, 2021, Lil Nas X trolled fans by releasing the \"uncensored\" version. The title refers to the censoring of the naked shower dancing scene from the original. This version starts the same as the original, but when the shower head is shown just before the dance starts, the video appears to buffer, showing a spinning circle. The video stays this way for the remaining duration of the music video, never actually showing the rest of the video or uncensoring the censored scene. The music video was uploaded on Lil Nas X's YouTube channel through VeVo on 23 July 2021, and as of 4 March 2022, it had more than 309 Million views (309,137,916).\n\n\n== Track listings ==\nDigital download and streaming\"Industry Baby\" \u2013 3:32Digital download and streaming \u2013 2.0\"Industry Baby\" \u2013 3:32\n\"Industry Baby\" (Extended) \u2013 3:47\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nLil Nas X \u2013 vocals, songwriting\nJack Harlow \u2013 vocals, songwriting\nTake a Daytrip \u2013 production, vocal production\nDavid Biral \u2013 songwriting\nDenzel Baptiste \u2013 songwriting, recording engineering\nKanye West \u2013 songwriting, production\nNick Lee \u2013 songwriting, co-production, trombone\nRoy Lenzo \u2013 songwriting, recording engineering\nDavid Dickenson \u2013 recording assistant\nDrew Sliger \u2013 recording assistant, miscellaneous producer\nRaul Cubina \u2013 songwriting, programming\nMervin Hernandez \u2013 recording assistant\nEric Lagg \u2013 mastering\nPatrizio \"Teezio\" Pigliapoco \u2013 mixing\nRyan Svendsen \u2013 trumpet\nBlunt Action \u2013  cover art\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== Usage in other media ==\nThe song is featured in the video game Forza Horizon 5.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 2021\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIndustry Baby sheet music",

It was a much larger aircraft, able to operate from the latest aircraft carriers and carry a considerable array of armament. It featured an internal bomb bay that reduced drag when carrying heavy ordnance. Saddled with demanding requirements set forth by both the U.S. Marines and United States Army Air Forces, the manufacturer incorporated features of a \"multi-role\" aircraft into the design.The Model XSB2C-1 prototype initially suffered teething problems connected to its Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone engine and three-bladed propeller; further concerns included structural weaknesses, poor handling, directional instability, and bad stall characteristics. In 1939, a student took a model of the new Curtiss XSB2C-1 to the MIT wind tunnel. Professor of Aeronautical Engineering Otto C. Koppen was quoted as saying, \"if they build more than one of these, they are crazy\". He was referring to controllability issues with the small vertical tail.The first prototype made its maiden flight on 18 December 1940. It crashed on 8 February 1941 when its engine failed on approach, but Curtiss was asked to rebuild it. The fuselage was lengthened and a larger tail was fitted, while an autopilot was fitted to help the poor stability. The revised prototype flew again on 20 October 1941, but was destroyed when its wing failed during diving tests on 21 December 1941.Large-scale production had already been ordered on 29 November 1940, but a large number of modifications were specified for the production model. Fin and rudder area were increased, fuel capacity was increased, self-sealing fuel tanks were added, and the fixed armament was doubled to four 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in the wings, compared with the prototype's two cowling guns. The SB2C-1 was built with larger fuel tanks, improving its range considerably.\nThe program suffered so many delays that the Grumman TBF Avenger entered service before the Helldiver, even though the Avenger had begun its development two years later. Nevertheless, production tempo accelerated with production at Columbus, Ohio and two Canadian factories: Fairchild Aircraft Ltd. (Canada), which produced 300 (under the designations XSBF-l, SBF-l, SBF-3, and SBF-4E), and Canadian Car and Foundry, which built 894 (designated SBW-l, SBW-3, SBW-4, SBW-4E, and SBW-5), these models being respectively equivalent to their Curtiss-built counterparts. A total of 7,140 SB2Cs were produced in World War II.\n\n\n== Operational history ==\n\n\n=== US Navy ===\n\nThe U.S. Navy would not accept the SB2C until 880 modifications to the design and the changes on the production line had been made, delaying the Curtiss Helldiver's combat debut until 11 November 1943 with squadron VB-17 on Bunker Hill, when they attacked the Japanese-held port of Rabaul on the island of New Britain, north of Papua New Guinea. The first version of the SB2C-1 was kept stateside for training, its various development problems leading to only 200 being built. The first deployment model was the SB2C-1C. The SB2C-1 could deploy slats mechanically linked with landing gear actuators, that extended from the outer third of the wing leading edge to aid lateral control at low speeds. The early prognosis of the \"Beast\" was unfavourable; it was strongly disliked by aircrews due to its size, weight, and reduced range compared to the SBD it replaced.\n\nIn the Battle of the Philippine Sea, 45 Helldivers, most of which had been launched from extreme range, were lost when they ran out of fuel while returning to their carriers.Among its major faults, the Helldiver was underpowered, had a shorter range than the SBD, was equipped with an unreliable electrical system, and was often poorly manufactured. The Curtiss-Electric propeller and the complex hydraulic system had frequent maintenance problems. One of the faults remaining with the aircraft through its operational life was poor longitudinal stability, resulting from a fuselage that was too short due to the necessity of fitting onto aircraft carrier elevators. The Helldiver's aileron response was also poor and handling suffered greatly under 90 kn (100 mph; 170 km/h) airspeed; since the speed of approach to land on a carrier was supposed to be 85 kn (98 mph; 157 km/h), this proved problematic. The 880 changes demanded by the Navy and modification of the aircraft to its combat role resulted in a 42% weight increase, explaining much of the problem.The solution to these problems began with the introduction of the SB2C-3 beginning in 1944, which used the R-2600-20 Twin Cyclone engine with 1,900 hp (1,400 kW) and Curtiss' four-bladed propeller. This substantially solved the chronic lack of power that had plagued the aircraft. The Helldivers would participate in battles over the Marianas, Philippines (partly responsible for sinking the battleship Musashi), Taiwan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa (in the sinking of the battleship Yamato). They were also used in the 1945 attacks on the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese home island of Honsh\u016b in tactical attacks on airfields, communications and shipping. They were also used extensively in patrols during the period between the dropping of the atomic bombs and the official Japanese surrender, and in the immediate pre-occupation period.\nAn oddity of the SB2Cs with 1942 to 1943-style tricolor camouflage was that the undersides of the outer wing panels carried dark topside camouflage because the undersurfaces were visible from above when the wings were folded.\nIn operational experience, it was found that the U.S. Navy's Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair fighters were able to carry an equally heavy bomb load against ground targets and were vastly more capable of defending themselves against enemy fighters. The Helldiver, however, could still deliver ordnance with more precision against specific targets and its two-seat configuration permitted a second set of eyes. A Helldiver also has a significant advantage in range over a fighter while carrying a bombload, which is extremely important in naval operations.\nThe advent of air-to-ground rockets ensured that the SB2C was the last purpose-built dive bomber produced. Rockets allowed precision attack against surface naval and land targets, while avoiding the stresses of near-vertical dives and the demanding performance requirements that they placed on dive bombers.\n \nThe SB2C remained in active postwar service in active duty US Navy squadrons until 1947 and in Naval Reserve aviation units until 1950. Surplus aircraft were sold to the naval air forces of France, Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Thailand. Greek SB2Cs served in combat in the Greek Civil War with additional machine guns mounted in wing pods. French SB2Cs flew in the First Indochina War from 1951 to 1954.\n\n\n=== US Army and US Marine Corps service ===\nBuilt at Curtiss' St. Louis plant, 900 aircraft were ordered by the USAAF under the designation A-25A Shrike. The first ten aircraft had folding wings, while the remainder of the production order omitted this feature. Many other changes distinguished the A-25A, including larger main wheels, a pneumatic tailwheel, ring and bead gunsight, longer exhaust stubs, and other Army-specified radio equipment. By late 1943, when the A-25A was being introduced, the USAAF no longer had a role for the dive bomber, as fighter aircraft such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt had shown their ability to carry out tactical air support missions with great success.\nThe USAAF transferred 410 Helldivers to the US Marines. The A-standard 25As were converted to the USMC variant, SB2C-1 and one squadron, VMSB-151, based on Enjebi (a.k.a. Engebi/Enjibe; part of Enewetak Atoll) conducted bombing missions on bypassed Japanese strongpoints nearby. Otherwise, the SB2C-1 variant never saw combat, and was used primarily as a trainer and target tug.\n\n\n=== Australian service ===\n\nAt an early stage of World War II, the Australian government noted that the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) lacked dedicated dive bombers and ordered 150 Curtiss Shrikes. These aircraft were paid for by the US Government as Lend Lease aid.By November 1943, when the first shipment of 10 Shrikes arrived in Australia, the RAAF had decided that dive bombing was an outmoded tactic. Vultee Vengeance dive bombers, which were already in service with the RAAF, were being replaced by light bombers. As a result, the order for the remaining 140 Shrikes was cancelled.While the 10 aircraft received were taken on strength, with the RAAF serial prefix A69, only one of these Shrikes officially took to the air in RAAF service. A69-4 was assigned to No. 1 Air Performance Unit, for performance testing, between December 1943 and April 1944.  The RAAF and US Fifth Air Force already operated a joint pool of aircraft types common to both services in the South West Pacific theatre and, by mid-January 1944, the other nine Shrikes had been transferred to USAAF units.  A69-4 was also transferred to the USAAF in December 1944.\n\n\n=== British service ===\nThe Helldiver's service with the British resembled Australian experience with the type. A total of 26 aircraft, out of 450 ordered, were delivered to the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, where they were known as the Helldiver I. After unsatisfactory tests by the A&AEE that pinpointed \"appalling handling\", none of the British Helldivers were used in action.\n\n\n=== Greek service ===\n\nAmerican aid provided the Royal Hellenic Air Force with 48 Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldivers from surplus U.S. Navy stocks. The aircraft were delivered by the aircraft carrier USS Sicily (CVE-118) in the spring of 1949. From the 48 aircraft, 6 were used for ground instruction or spare parts and 42 were given to 336th Fighter Squadron (336 \u039c\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 \u0394\u03b9\u03ce\u03be\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2) to replace Supermarine Spitfires and the squadron's name was changed to 336th Bomber Squadron (336 \u039c\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 \u0392\u03bf\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd).Greek SB2C-5 Helldivers had minor changes for their COIN operations: the hard rubber tailwheel (for carrier use) was replaced by a bigger pneumatic tire for use on landing strips; and the rear gunner station and its twin MGs were deleted, as no aerial opposition existed and weight reduction was used for bombs and extra machine guns.\nCurtiss SB2C-5 Helldivers, Supermarine Spitfires, and North American T-6D/Gs were used in ground-attack missions against Communist ground forces, camps, and transports during the last stages of the Greek Civil War.Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldivers saw a relatively brief combat service and were gradually phased out by 1953. A few were in use until 1957 as photographic aircraft. One Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldiver was restored in 1997 and is displayed in the Hellenic Air Force Museum.\n\n\n=== French service ===\n\nBetween 1949 and 1954, France bought 110 SB2C-5 Helldiver aircraft to replace their aging SBD-5 Dauntless that had been flying in combat in Vietnam. The French Aeronavale flew the Helldiver from 1951 to 1958.\nSome of these aircraft were allotted to flottilles 3F and 9F stationed on board the carriers Arromanches, Bois Belleau, and La Fayette, during the First Indochina War. The Helldivers were used to support French troops on the ground during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954.\n\n\n== Variants ==\nXSB2C-1\nPrototype powered by a 1,700 hp (1,268 kW) R-2600-8 engine\nSB2C-1\nProduction version for United States Navy with four 0.50 in (12.7 mm) wing guns and one 0.30 in (7.62 mm) dorsal gun, 200 built.\nSB2C-1A\nOriginal designation for United States Army Air Corps version which became A-25A later used for 410 A-25As transferred to the United States Marine Corps.\nSB2C-1C\nSB2C-1 with two 20 mm (0.79 in) wing-mounted cannons and hydraulically operated flaps, 778 built.

This late-production Helldiver, built in 1945, makes frequent air show appearances. In 1982, it experienced engine failure and a hard emergency landing that caused extensive damage; volunteers of the CAF put in thousands of hours and spent in excess of $200,000 to restore the aircraft to flying condition once more. As of October 2018, it is still the only flying example in the world.On displaySB2C-583479 - Steven F.

It crashed on 28 May 1945 in Lower Otay Reservoir, near San Diego, California after engine failure during a training exercise. Both pilot E.D. Frazer and his passenger escaped uninjured, but the Helldiver sank in 90 ft. of water. The aircraft was discovered in February 2010 by a fisherman and recovered on 20 August 2010 for restoration.SB2C-583393 - for display at the Fagen Fighters WWII Museum in Granite Falls, Minnesota.WrecksA SB2C-4E Helldiver belonging to the United States Navy crashed and burned in foul weather on October 9, 1945, while en route from New Cumberland, Pennsylvania to its base at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile, Michigan after participating in Nimitz Day celebrations held in Washington, D.C. Pilot Frank Campbell and gunner George Cohlmia, both World War II veterans, were killed in the crash. The remains of the plane are still located at the crash site on Laurel Hill in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania, three miles southeast of the village of Waterford.\nIn January 2010, a scuba diver discovered a SB2C-1C Helldiver that was ditched in Maalaea Bay off South Maui in August 1944. The Helldiver is covered in coral and is missing its tail section. The aircraft experienced problems with its empennage after dive bombing maneuvers which forced pilot Lieutenant William Dill to ditch. It lies in 50 ft of water facing east. The site, which is protected under state and federal law, is in the process of being marked with a plaque by the U.S. Navy. A mooring may be installed at a later point in time to facilitate dives on the site.\nOn 25 March 2010, the Oregon State Police, Tillamook County Sheriff's Office, and the United States Navy announced that during a logging operation near Rockaway Beach, Oregon, the wreck of an SB2C Helldiver was located. Initial responders believe there may be human remains on the scene.\nOn 19 December 2011 Scuba divers off the coast of Jupiter, Florida came across an SB2C Helldiver while under water. The aircraft is mostly intact and was found inverted with the landing gear retracted. In May 2012, the US Navy conducted a survey of the aircraft, recovering a data plate from the horizontal stabilizer. The Naval History and Heritage Command's Underwater Archaeology Branch is actively trying to determine if the numbers stamped on the data plate are readable and will identify the aircraft.\n\n\n== Specifications (SB2C-4 Helldiver) ==\n\nData from United States Navy Aircraft since 1911General characteristics\nCrew: 2\nLength: 36 ft 8 in (11.18 m)\nWingspan: 49 ft 9 in (15.16 m)\nHeight: 13 ft 2 in (4.01 m)\nWing area: 422 sq ft (39.2 m2)\nAirfoil: root: NACA 23017; tip: NACA 23009\nEmpty weight: 10,547 lb (4,784 kg)\nGross weight: 16,616 lb (7,537 kg)\nPowerplant: 1 \u00d7 Wright R-2600-20 Twin Cyclone 14-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engine, 1,900 hp (1,400 kW)\nPropellers: 4-bladed constant-speed propellerPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 295 mph (475 km/h, 256 kn) at 16,700 ft (5,100 m)\nCruise speed: 158 mph (254 km/h, 137 kn)\nCombat range: 1,165 mi (1,875 km, 1,012 nmi) with 1,000 lb (450 kg) bomb-load\nService ceiling: 29,100 ft (8,900 m)\nRate of climb: 1,800 ft/min (9.1 m/s)Armament\nGuns: **2 \u00d7 20 mm (0.787 in) AN/M2 cannon in the wings\n2 \u00d7 0.30 in (7.6 mm) M1919 Browning machine guns in the rear cockpit\n4 X 0.50 in (13 mm) M2 Browning machine guns, two each in gunpods mounted on underwing hardpoints (optional)\nRockets: 8 \u00d7 5 in (127 mm) high velocity aircraft rockets\nBombs: in internal bay: 2,000 lb (910 kg) of bombs or 1 \u00d7 Mark 13-2 torpedoon underwing hardpoints: 500 lb (230 kg) of bombs each\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nRelated development\n\nCurtiss SBC Helldiver\nCurtiss XSB3C\nCurtiss XBT2CAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\n\nAichi B7A\nBrewster SB2A Buccaneer/Bermuda\nDouglas A-33\nDouglas BTD Destroyer\nFairey Barracuda\nFairey Fulmar\nJunkers Ju 187\nMitsubishi Ki-51\nSaab 17C\nSukhoi Su-2\nSupermarine Type 322\nVultee A-31 Vengeance\nYokosuka D4Y\nRelated lists\n\nList of aircraft of World War II\nList of United States Navy aircraft designations (pre-1962)\nList of military aircraft of the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"I Ride 'The Beast'.\" by J.

        "Easy On Me, Adele": [
            "\"Easy on Me\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Adele released on 15 October 2021, through Columbia Records as the lead single from her fourth studio album, 30 (2021). Her first musical release in nearly five years, \"Easy on Me\" was produced by American record producer Greg Kurstin, who also co-wrote the song with Adele. It is a minimally produced pop ballad, set to a prominent, sombre piano, and propelled by sparse bass beats.

Commercially, \"Easy on Me\" was an international success, entering the top 10 in 40 territories and topping the charts in 27 of those. In the United Kingdom and United States, the song marked Adele's third and fifth chart toppers, respectively. \"Easy on Me\" broke the Spotify and Amazon Music records for the most streams for a song in a day or a week. It became the longest running number-one song on the US Billboard Hot 100 by a female artist in the 2020s decade, with ten weeks atop the chart.An accompanying music video, directed by Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan and shot in Sutton, Quebec, was released on 15 October 2021, continuing the setting established in the music video for Adele's 2015 song \"Hello\", where she is seen entering a furnished house. In the \"Easy on Me\" video, Adele vacates the house and drives off in a truck as a pile of sheet music flies out of it, littering the road. A duet version with Chris Stapleton was featured on Target and Japanese editions of 30 and was released to country radio in the US on 19 November 2021. It won the Brit Award for British Single at the 2022 Brit Awards.\n\n",

It became the longest running number-one song on the US Billboard Hot 100 by a female artist in the 2020s decade, with ten weeks atop the chart.An accompanying music video, directed by Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan and shot in Sutton, Quebec, was released on 15 October 2021, continuing the setting established in the music video for Adele's 2015 song \"Hello\", where she is seen entering a furnished house. In the \"Easy on Me\" video, Adele vacates the house and drives off in a truck as a pile of sheet music flies out of it, littering the road. A duet version with Chris Stapleton was featured on Target and Japanese editions of 30 and was released to country radio in the US on 19 November 2021. It won the Brit Award for British Single at the 2022 Brit Awards.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\n\"Easy on Me\" is a piano-driven pop ballad joined by bass drum beats halfway. The song's chorus consists of its title sung in prominently elongated vocal runs. The song is written in the key of F major with a slow tempo of 70 beats per minute. The song opens with a solo piano, which leads into the vocals.Lyrically, Adele addresses her nine-year-old son Angelo in \"Easy on Me\", explaining to him her divorce from his father and beseeching him to be \"easy on [her]\". According to Stephanee Wang writing for Nylon, Adele wrote the lyrics in reaction to her divorce proceedings stating: \"In 2019, the story broke that after 11 years together, she and her ex-husband, Simon Konecki, had separated, with their divorce getting finalized in March 2021.\" Wang said the lyrics directly speak to Angelo, \"as [Adele] tries to explain to him why she decided to split from his father and choose a new path for the two of them.\" Adele had also previously stated: \"I just felt like I wanted to explain to [Angelo], through this record, when he\u2019s in his twenties or thirties, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness. It made him really unhappy sometimes. And that's a real wound for me that I don't know if I'll ever be able to heal.\"\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nOn 1 October 2021, multiple posters and projections stating \"30\" appeared on significant landmarks and buildings in different cities around the world. Instalments of the logo were largely linked to the title of Adele's upcoming studio album. On 4 October, the singer's social media accounts were updated for the first time in months. The following day, Adele teased the song and its music video through an instrumental clip she posted on her social media. The black-and-white teaser shows Adele putting a cassette tape into the tape deck of a truck and turning up the volume. She then drives off with the windows rolled down, while piles of sheet music fly out of the windows. Billboard writer Gil Kaufman thought the visuals were \"Adele to the core\". The teaser was widely compared to the music video of Adele's previous lead single, \"Hello\" (2015). The teaser clip of the song garnered over 17 million views, becoming the most viewed clip by a female artist on Twitter.During an interview with Vogue, it was revealed that long-time collaborator Greg Kurstin worked on the song. The staff at Capital FM interpreted the song title as documenting the \"start of a blossoming relationship\". On 9 October, the singer shared a 40-second preview of the song via Instagram Live. \"Easy on Me\" was released on 15 October 2021, to all digital music platforms. It marked the first single by Adele in nearly five years.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nUpon release, \"Easy on Me\" received positive reviews from music critics. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph called the song a \"bold comeback single\", contrasting its simple piano arrangement with the sleek power ballad production of \"Hello\". He said Adele possesses a heartfelt voice, one \"that digs deepest into the soul of the world.\" Evening Standard writer Jochan Embley lauded \"Easy on Me\" for its plaintive piano, elegant vocals, and \"lilting\" melodies. He said the song is a testament to Adele's resistance to pop music trends, avoiding \"bombastic hyperpop or anodyne reggaeton\" and staying true to her style. Nevertheless, Embley felt the song \"doesn't quite match the mascara-streaked sorrow of 'Someone like You' (2011), or the soaring emotional heights of 'Hello'. But it is just about as powerful.\"NME's Nick Levine proclaimed \"Adele's has never sounded better\" than on \"Easy on Me\", making a comeback with a \"slice of classic Adele balladry.\" Music critic Alexandra Pollard, writing for The Independent, opined that \"Easy on Me\" has Adele \"addressing her nine-year-old son, attempting to explain to him why she chose to take apart the life he knew.\" Pollard admired the \"raspy\" vocals, sentimental lyrics, polished sound, and the piano composition evocative of \"Exile\" (2020) by Taylor Swift and Bon Iver. He nevertheless found the chorus of \"Easy on Me\" less catchy than that of \"Hello\". In his The Guardian review, music journalist Alexis Petridis highlighted the typical \"Adele-esque\" sound of the song, consisting of soulful vocals and relatable lyrics, and added that, though \"Easy on Me\" is not as arresting as \"Someone like You\", it is still better than some forgettable tracks on 25 (2015).Fiona Sturges of i hailed it as a \"heartfelt, anthemic\" song that puts Adele's \"remarkable instrument\"\u2014her voice\u2014at the forefront; later in the review, Sturges expressed her concern over how the song's \"slightly over-produced sheen\" prevents it from being more heartaching. Pitchfork critic Cat Zhang wrote \"Easy on Me\" sticks to a classic formula, \"for better or worse\". Zhang praised Adele's vocal delivery, and deemed the song a \"stirring ballad\" even though it \"isn't really treading new ground within [Adele's] own discography\". Dubbing it a \"great tune\" that is not as impressive as Adele's previous lead singles, The Times' Will Hodgkinson said \"Easy on Me\" is \"nice and accomplished\" but felt \"a sheen of thoroughly American professionalism that stops the emotions from really hitting home in the way they did on \"Someone like You\".\"\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nUpon release, \"Easy on Me\" broke the all-time record for the most streamed song in a single day on Spotify with 24 million global streams, as well as the record for the most streamed song in a single week with 84.9 million streams. It additionally broke two Amazon Music records, the most first-day streams globally, and the most first-day Alexa requests for any song in the platform's history.\"Easy on Me\" debuted at number 195 on the Billboard Global 200 from its first five hours of tracking, drawing 16,900 downloads and 7.7 million streams within the timeframe, before rocketing to the chart's top spot the following week.

            "\"Money\" (stylized in all caps) is a song by Thai rapper, singer, and Blackpink member Lisa from her debut single album Lalisa (2021). It was released to US contemporary hit radio by Interscope Records as the second single from the album on November 9, 2021 after achieving viral success. The lyrics for the track were written by Bekuh Boom and Vince, with music being composed by them alongside 24 and R.

U.S., becoming the longest-charting song by a K-pop soloist on both charts, and at number 90 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also topped the charts in Malaysia and figured within the record charts of 26 countries.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nOn August 25, 2021, YG Entertainment announced that Lisa would make her solo debut with the single album titled after her given name, Lalisa. \"Money\" was confirmed as the B-side track on the tracklist of the single album on September 5. The song was released alongside the album on September 10, and received a performance video on September 24. Following its release, \"Money\" trended on TikTok and Instagram Reels in the form of dance covers, transformation edits, and edits to the television series Squid Game, and began to rise in the international charts. In response to its viral success, the song was sent by Interscope Records to US contemporary hit radio as the second single from the album on November 9, 2021.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe song's lyrics were written by Bekuh Boom and Vince, and music was composed by them alongside 24 and R. Tee. Lyrically it is a boastful song about being rich and spending cash. The song is composed in the key of E minor and carries a tempo of 140 beats per minute, and is described as a dynamic hip hop song. Nolan Feeney from Billboard explained the music of the song is close to the \"contemporary American rap\" and is \"built around a languid horn loop.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Money\" received mixed to positive reviews, with Lisa's performance and rapping receiving praise; on the other hand, some criticized the song's composition and lyrical content. Rhian Daly of NME criticized the lyrics as \"cringe-y at best\" and the sound as \"obvious, safe and boring.\" In a more positive assessment, Starr Bowenbank of Billboard stated that the track exhibits the \"full extent of her rap skills, star power and crossover appeal.\" Writing for Teen Vogue, Maddy Meyer similarly stated that \"from the start, this song draws the listener in\" and that it \"has all the confidence Lisa is known for.\"\n\n\n=== Year-end lists ===\n\n\n== Performance video ==\n\nOn September 20, 2021, release of a \"exclusive performance video\" for \"Money\" was announced. Initially scheduled for the release on September 23, at 12 a.m. KST, the release was postponed by a day because of the delay in the post-production of the video due to Chuseok holiday. In March 2022, it became the fastest K-pop performance video to reach 500 million views on YouTube, doing so in less than sixth months.In the video, Lisa along with the backup dancers gives a choreographed performance for the song in two inter-changing settings. The video starts with Lisa dancing in the middle of an abandoned road wearing a khaki-colored ensemble and green Celine chest. A billboard reading \"money is a terrible master but an excellent servant\" beams in the background. In the other setting, Lisa wears a checkered crop top and bralette combo, red tap shorts, and fur boots performing in a warehouse with a white LED screen at the back.A dance practice video was additionally released on October 11, 2021. The dance practice video topped the worldwide trending list on YouTube and reached 10 million views in one day.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Money\" debuted at number 44 on the Billboard Global 200 and at number 24 on the Global Excl. U.S. for the chart issue dated September 25, 2021, and rose to number 19 and 11 respectively for the chart issue dated October 16. Following the dance practice video, the song rose from number 19 to 10 on the Global 200 with 66.3 million streams (up 28%) and 4,400 sold (up 6%) for the chart issue dated October 23. The song also rose from number 11 to 7 on the Global Excl. U.S. with 61.5 million streams (up 28%) and 3,000 sold (down 3%) for the same week. This marked Lisa's second top-ten hit on both charts after \"Lalisa\" and made her the third K-pop artist after BTS and Blackpink to appear in the top ten of the global chart more than once. \"Money\" charted on the Global 200 for over sixteen weeks, becoming the longest charting song by a K-pop soloist and the second-longest charting song by any female K-pop act, behind Blackpink's single \"How You Like That\". The song also climbed to number five on the Spotify Global Chart and became the fastest by a K-pop soloist to surpass 100 million streams on Spotify, doing so in only 37 days.In the United States, the song debuted at number eight on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart dated September 25, 2021 with 6,900 online copies sold.

            "A mondegreen  is a mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase in a way that gives it a new meaning. Mondegreens are most often created by a person listening to a poem or a song; the listener, being unable to hear a lyric clearly, substitutes words that sound similar and make some kind of sense.  American writer Sylvia Wright coined the term in 1954, writing that as a girl, when her mother read to her from Thomas Percy's 1765 book Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, she had misheard the lyric \"layd him on the green\" as \"Lady Mondegreen\" in the fourth line of the Scottish ballad \"The Bonny Earl of Murray\".\"Mondegreen\" was included in the 2000 edition of the Random House Webster's College Dictionary, and in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2002. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary added the word in 2008.",

            "A mondegreen  is a mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase in a way that gives it a new meaning. Mondegreens are most often created by a person listening to a poem or a song; the listener, being unable to hear a lyric clearly, substitutes words that sound similar and make some kind of sense.  American writer Sylvia Wright coined the term in 1954, writing that as a girl, when her mother read to her from Thomas Percy's 1765 book Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, she had misheard the lyric \"layd him on the green\" as \"Lady Mondegreen\" in the fourth line of the Scottish ballad \"The Bonny Earl of Murray\".\"Mondegreen\" was included in the 2000 edition of the Random House Webster's College Dictionary, and in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2002. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary added the word in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn a 1954 essay in Harper's Magazine, Sylvia Wright described how, as a young girl, she misheard the last line of the first stanza from the seventeenth-century ballad \"The Bonnie Earl O' Moray\". She wrote:\n\nWhen I was a child, my mother used to read aloud to me from Percy's Reliques, and one of my favorite poems began, as I remember:\n\nThe correct fourth line is, \"And laid him on the green\". Wright explained the need for a new term:\n\nThe point about what I shall hereafter call mondegreens, since no one else has thought up a word for them, is that they are better than the original.\n\n\n== Psychology ==\nPeople are more likely to notice what they expect than things not part of their everyday experiences; this is known as confirmation bias. Similarly, one may mistake an unfamiliar stimulus for a familiar and more plausible version. For example, to consider a well-known mondegreen in the song \"Purple Haze\", one would be more likely to hear Jimi Hendrix singing that he is about to kiss this guy than that he is about to kiss the sky. Similarly, if a lyric uses words or phrases that the listener is unfamiliar with, they may be misheard as using more familiar terms.\nThe creation of mondegreens may be driven in part by cognitive dissonance, as the listener finds it psychologically uncomfortable to listen to a song and not make out the words. Steven Connor suggests that mondegreens are the result of the brain's constant attempts to make sense of the world by making assumptions to fill in the gaps when it cannot clearly determine what it is hearing. Connor sees mondegreens as the \"wrenchings of nonsense into sense\". This dissonance will be most acute when the lyrics are in a language in which the listener is fluent.On the other hand, Steven Pinker has observed that mondegreen mishearings tend to be less plausible than the original lyrics, and that once a listener has \"locked in\" to a particular misheard interpretation of a song's lyrics, it can remain unquestioned, even when that plausibility becomes strained (see mumpsimus). Pinker gives the example of a student \"stubbornly\" mishearing the chorus to \"Venus\" (\"I'm your Venus\") as \"I'm your penis\", and being surprised that the song was allowed on the radio. The phenomenon may, in some cases, be triggered by people hearing \"what they want to hear\", as in the case of the song \"Louie Louie\": parents heard obscenities in the Kingsmen recording where none existed.James Gleick claims that the mondegreen is a distinctly modern phenomenon. Without the improved communication and language standardization brought about by radio, he believes there would have been no way to recognize and discuss this shared experience. Just as mondegreens transform songs based on experience, a folk song learned by repetition often is transformed over time when sung by people in a region where some of the song's references have become obscure. A classic example is \"The Golden Vanity\", which contains the line \"As she sailed upon the lowland sea\". British immigrants carried the song to Appalachia, where singers, not knowing what the term lowland sea refers to, transformed it over generations from \"lowland\" to \"lonesome\".\n\n\n== Notable examples ==\n\n\n=== Notable collections ===\nThe classicist and linguist Steve Reece has collected examples of English mondegreens in song lyrics, religious creeds and liturgies, commercials and advertisements, and jokes and riddles.  He has used this collection to shed light on the process of \"junctural metanalysis\" during the oral transmission of the ancient Greek epics, the Iliad and Odyssey.\n\n\n=== In songs ===\nThe national anthem of the United States is highly susceptible to the creation of mondegreens, two in the first line. Francis Scott Key's \"Star-Spangled Banner\" begins with the line \"O say can you see, by the dawn's early light\". This has been accidentally and deliberately misinterpreted as \"Jos\u00e9, can you see\", another example of the Hobson-Jobson effect, countless times. The second half of the line has been misheard as well, as \"by the donzerly light\", or other variants. This has led to many people believing that \"donzerly\" is an actual word.Religious songs, learned by ear (and often by children), are another common source of mondegreens. The most-cited example is \"Gladly, the cross-eyed bear\" (from the line in the hymn \"Keep Thou My Way\" by Fanny Crosby and Theodore E. Perkins, \"Kept by Thy tender care, gladly the cross I'll bear\"). Jon Carroll and many others quote it as \"Gladly the cross I'd bear\"; also, here, hearers are confused by the sentence with the unusual object-subject-verb (OSV) word order.\nMondegreens expanded as a phenomenon with radio, and, especially, the growth of rock and roll (and even more so with rap). Amongst the most-reported examples are:\n\"There's a bathroom on the right\" (the line at the end of each verse of \"Bad Moon Rising\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival: \"There's a bad moon on the rise\").\n\"Scuse me while I kiss this guy\" (from a lyric in the song \"Purple Haze\" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"'Scuse me while I kiss the sky\").\n\"The girl with colitis goes by\" (from a lyric in the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\":  \"The girl with kaleidoscope eyes\")Both Creedence's John Fogerty and Hendrix eventually acknowledged these mishearings by deliberately singing the \"mondegreen\" versions of their songs in concert.\"Blinded by the Light\", a cover of a Bruce Springsteen song by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, contains what has been called \"probably the most misheard lyric of all time\". The phrase \"revved up like a deuce\", altered from Springsteen's original \"cut loose like a deuce\", both lyrics referring to the hot rodders slang deuce (short for deuce coup\u00e9) for a 1932 Ford coup\u00e9, is frequently misheard as \"wrapped up like a douche\". Springsteen himself has joked about the phenomenon, claiming that it was not until Manfred Mann rewrote the song to be about a \"feminine hygiene product\" that the song became popular.Another commonly-cited example of a song susceptible to mondegreens is Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", with the line \"here we are now, entertain us\" variously being misinterpreted as \"here we are now, in containers\", and \"here we are now, hot potatoes\", amongst other renditions.\nRap and hip hop lyrics may be particularly susceptible to being misheard because they do not necessarily follow standard pronunciations. The delivery of rap lyrics relies heavily upon an often regional pronunciation or non-traditional accenting of words and their phonemes to adhere to the artist's stylizations and the lyrics' written structure. This issue is exemplified in controversies over alleged transcription errors in Yale University Press's 2010 Anthology of Rap.\n\n\n=== Standardized and recorded mondegreens ===\nSometimes, the modified version of a lyric becomes standard, as is the case with \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\". The original has \"four colly birds\" (colly means black; cf. A Midsummer Night's Dream: \"Brief as the lightning in the collied night\".); by the turn of the twentieth century, these became calling birds, which is the lyric used in the 1909 Frederic Austin version.A number of misheard lyrics have been recorded, turning a mondegreen into a real title. The song \"Sea Lion Woman\", recorded in 1939 by Christine and Katherine Shipp, was performed by Nina Simone under the title, \"See Line Woman\". According to the liner notes from the compilation A Treasury of Library of Congress Field Recordings, the correct title of this playground song might also be \"See [the] Lyin' Woman\" or \"C-Line Woman\". Jack Lawrence's misinterpretation of the French phrase \"pauvre Jean\" (\"poor John\") as the identically pronounced \"pauvres gens\" (\"poor people\") led to the translation of La Goualante du pauvre Jean (\"The Ballad of Poor John\") as \"The Poor People of Paris\", a hit song in 1956.\n\n\n=== In literature ===\nA Monk Swimming by author Malachy McCourt is so titled because of a childhood mishearing of a phrase from the Catholic rosary prayer, Hail Mary. \"Amongst women\" became \"a monk swimmin'\".The title and plot of the short science fiction story \"Come You Nigh: Kay Shuns\" (\"Com-mu-ni-ca-tions\") by Lawrence A. Perkins, in Analog Science Fiction and Fact magazine (April 1970), deals with securing interplanetary radio communications by encoding them with mondegreens.Olive, the Other Reindeer is a 1997 children's book by Vivian Walsh, which borrows its title from a mondegreen of the line, \"all of the other reindeer\" in the song \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\". The book was adapted into an animated Christmas special in 1999.\nThe travel guide book series Lonely Planet is named after the misheard phrase \"lovely planet\" sung by Joe Cocker in Matthew Moore's song \"Space Captain\".\n\n\n=== In film ===\nA monologue of mondegreens appears in the 1971 film Carnal Knowledge. The camera focuses on actress Candice Bergen laughing as she recounts various phrases that fooled her as a child, including \"Round John Virgin\" (instead of \u201c\u2018Round yon virgin...\u201d) and \"Gladly, the cross-eyed bear\" (instead of \u201cGladly the cross I\u2019d bear\u201d). The title of the 2013 film Ain't Them Bodies Saints is a misheard lyric from a folk song; director David Lowery decided to use it because it evoked the \"classical, regional\" feel of 1970s rural Texas.In the 1994 film The Santa Clause, a child identifies a ladder that Santa uses to get to the roof from its label: The Rose Suchak Ladder Company. He states that this is \"just like the poem\", misinterpreting \"out on the lawn there arose such a clatter\" from A Visit from St. Nicholas as \"Out on the lawn, there's a Rose Suchak ladder\".\n\n\n=== In television ===\nMondegreens have been used in many television advertising campaigns, including:\n\nAn advertisement for the 2012 Volkswagen Passat touting the car's audio system shows a number of people singing incorrect versions of the line \"Burning out his fuse up here alone\" from the Elton John/Bernie Taupin song \"Rocket Man\", until a woman listening to the song in a Passat realizes the correct words.\nA 2002 advertisement for T-Mobile shows spokeswoman Catherine Zeta-Jones helping to correct a man who has misunderstood the chorus of Def Leppard's \"Pour Some Sugar On Me\" as \"pour some shook up ramen\".\nA series of advertisements for Maxell audio cassette tapes, produced by Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury, shown in 1989 and 1990, featured misheard versions of \"Israelites\" (e.g., \"Me ears are alight\") by Desmond Dekker and \"Into the Valley\" by The Skids as heard by users of other brands of tape.\nA 1987 series of advertisements for Kellogg's Nut 'n Honey Crunch featured a joke in which one person asks \"What's for breakfast?\" and is told \"Nut 'N' Honey\", which is misheard as \"Nothing, honey\".\n\n\n=== Other notable examples ===\nThe traditional game Chinese whispers (\"Telephone\" or \"Gossip\" in North America) involves mishearing a whispered sentence to produce successive mondegreens that gradually distort the original sentence as it is repeated by successive listeners.\nAmong schoolchildren in the US, daily rote recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance has long provided opportunities for the genesis of mondegreens.Speech-to-text functionality in modern smartphone messaging apps and search or assist functions may be hampered by faulty speech recognition. It has been noted that in text messaging, users often leave uncorrected mondegreens as a joke or puzzle for the recipient to solve. This wealth of mondegreens has proven to be a fertile ground for study by speech scientists and psychologists.\n\n\n== Reverse mondegreen ==\nA reverse mondegreen is the intentional production, in speech or writing, of words or phrases that seem to be gibberish but disguise meaning. A prominent example is Mairzy Doats, a 1943 novelty song by Milton Drake, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston. The lyrics are a reverse mondegreen, made up of same-sounding words or phrases (sometimes also referred to as \"oronyms\"), so pronounced (and written) as to challenge the listener (or reader) to interpret them:\n\nMairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey\nA kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?The clue to the meaning is contained in the bridge of the song:\n\nIf the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled and jivey,\nSing \"Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy.\"This makes it clear that the last line is \"A kid'll eat ivy, too; wouldn't you?\"\n\n\n== Deliberate mondegreen ==\n\nTwo authors have written books of supposed foreign-language poetry that are actually mondegreens of nursery rhymes in English. Luis van Rooten's pseudo-French Mots D'Heures: Gousses, Rames includes critical, historical, and interpretive apparatus, as does John Hulme's M\u00f6rder Guss Reims, attributed to a fictitious German poet. Both titles sound like the phrase \"Mother Goose Rhymes\". Both works can also be considered soramimi, which produces different meanings when interpreted in another language. The genre of animutation is based on deliberate mondegreen.\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart produced a similar effect in his canon \"Difficile Lectu\" (Difficult to Read), which, though ostensibly in Latin, is actually an opportunity for scatological humor in both German and Italian.Some performers and writers have used deliberate mondegreens to create double entendres. The phrase \"if you see Kay\" (F-U-C-K) has been employed many times, notably as a line from James Joyce's 1922 novel Ulysses.\"Mondegreen\" is a song by Yeasayer on their 2010 album, Odd Blood. The lyrics are intentionally obscure (for instance, \"Everybody sugar in my bed\" and \"Perhaps the pollen in the air turns us into a stapler\") and spoken hastily to encourage the mondegreen effect.Anguish Languish is an ersatz language created by Howard L. Chace. A play on the words \"English Language,\" it is based on homophonic transformations of English words and consists entirely of deliberate mondegreens that seem nonsensical in print but are readily understood when spoken aloud. A notable example is the story \"Ladle Rat Rotten Hut\" (\"Little Red Riding Hood\"), which appears in his collection of stories and poems, Anguish Languish (Prentice-Hall, 1956).\n\n\n== Related linguistic phenomena ==\nClosely related categories are Hobson-Jobson, where a word from a foreign language is homophonically translated into one's own language, e.g. \"cockroach\" from Spanish cucaracha, and soramimi, a Japanese term for deliberate homophonic misinterpretation of words for humor.\nAn unintentionally incorrect use of similar-sounding words or phrases, resulting in a changed meaning, is a malapropism. If there is a connection in meaning, it may be called an eggcorn. If a person stubbornly continues to mispronounce a word or phrase after being corrected, that person has committed a mumpsimus.\n\n\n== Non-English languages ==\n\n\n=== Croatian ===\nQueen's song \"Another one bites the dust\" has a long-standing history as a mondegreen in Croatian, misheard as Radovan baca daske which means \"Radovan (personal name) throws planks\". This might also be a soramimi.\n\n\n=== Dutch ===\nIn Dutch, mondegreens are popularly referred to as Mama appelsap (\"Mommy applejuice\"), from the Michael Jackson song Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' which features the lyrics Mama-se mama-sa ma-ma-coo-sa, and was once misheard as Mama say mama sa mam[a]appelsap. The Dutch radio station 3FM had a show Superrradio (originally Timur Open Radio) run by Timur Perlin and Ramon with an item in which listeners were encouraged to send in mondegreens under the name \"Mama appelsap\". The segment was popular for years.\n\n\n=== French ===\nIn French, the phenomenon is also known as hallucination auditive, especially when referring to pop songs.\nThe title of the film La Vie en rose (\"Life in pink\") depicting the life of \u00c9dith Piaf can be mistaken for L'Avion rose' (\"The pink airplane\").\nThe title of the 1983 French novel Le Th\u00e9 au harem d'Archi Ahmed (\"Tea in the Harem of Archi Ahmed\") by Mehdi Charef (and the 1985 movie of the same name) is based on the main character mishearing le th\u00e9or\u00e8me d'Archim\u00e8de (\"the theorem of Archimedes\") in his mathematics class.\nA classic example in French is similar to the \"Lady Mondegreen\" anecdote: in his 1962 collection of children's quotes La Foire aux cancres, the humorist Jean-Charles refers to a misunderstood lyric of \"La Marseillaise\" (the French national anthem): Entendez-vous ... mugir ces f\u00e9roces soldats (\"Do you hear those savage soldiers roar?\") is misheard as ...S\u00e9f\u00e9ro, ce soldat (\"that soldier S\u00e9f\u00e9ro\").\n\n\n=== German ===\nMondegreens are a well-known phenomenon in German, especially where non-German songs are concerned. They are sometimes called, after a well-known example, Agathe Bauer-songs (\"I got the power\", a song by Snap!, misinterpreted as a German female name). Journalist Axel Hacke published a series of books about them, beginning with Der wei\u00dfe Neger Wumbaba (\"The White Negro Wumbaba\", a mishearing of the line der wei\u00dfe Nebel wunderbar from \"Der Mond ist aufgegangen\").In urban legend, children's paintings of nativity scenes, occasionally include next to the Child, Mary, Joseph, and so on, an additional, laughing creature known as the Owi. The reason is to be found in the line Gottes Sohn! O wie lacht / Lieb' aus Deinem g\u00f6ttlichen Mund (\"God's Son! Oh, how does love laugh out of Thy divine mouth!\") from the song \"Silent Night\". The subject is Lieb, a poetic contraction of die Liebe leaving off the final -e and the definite article, so that the phrase might be misunderstood as being about a person named Owi laughing \"in a loveable manner\". Owi lacht has been used as the title of at least one book about Christmas and Christmas songs.\n\n\n=== Hebrew ===\nGhil'ad Zuckermann mentions the example mukhrakh\u00edm liy\u00f3t sam\u00e9akh (\u05de\u05d5\u05db\u05e8\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u200e, which means \"we must be happy\", with a grammatical error) as a mondegreen of the original \u00faru 'akh\u00edm bel\u00e9v sam\u00e9akh (\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05dc\u05d1 \u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u200e, which means \"wake up, brothers, with a happy heart\"). Although this line is taken from the extremely well-known song \"H\u00e1va Nag\u00edla\" (\"Let\u2019s be happy\"), given the Hebrew high-register of \u00faru (\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u200e \"wake up!\"), Israelis often mishear it.\nAn Israeli site dedicated to Hebrew mondegreens has coined the term avatiach (\u05d0\u05d1\u05d8\u05d9\u05d7\u200e, Hebrew for \"watermelon\") for \"mondegreen\", named for a common mishearing of Shlomo Artzi's award-winning 1970 song \"Ahavtia\" (\"I loved her\", using a form uncommon in spoken Hebrew).\n\n\n=== Polish ===\nA paper in phonology cites memoirs of the poet Antoni S\u0142onimski, who confessed that in the recited poem Konrad Wallenrod he used to hear zwierz Alpuhary (\"a beast of Alpujarras\") rather than z wie\u017c Alpuhary (\"from the towers of Alpujarras\").\n\n\n=== Russian ===\nIn 1875 Fyodor Dostoyevsky cited a line from Fyodor Glinka's song \"Troika\" (1825), \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a, \u0434\u0430\u0440 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0434\u0430\u044f (\"the bell, gift of Valday\"), stating that it is usually understood as \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a, \u0434\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0434\u0430\u044f (\"the bell darvaldaying\" \u2014 supposedly an onomatopoeia of ringing sounds).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nConnor, Steven.

            "\"Deja Vu\" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo. It was released on April 1, 2021, as the second single from Rodrigo's debut studio album, Sour (2021), through Geffen and Interscope Records. The song was announced on her website and via her social media accounts on March 29, 2021, and served as a follow-up to her globally successful debut single, \"Drivers License\".\nRodrigo wrote the song with its producer Dan Nigro. Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff and St. Vincent also received songwriting credits since it interpolates Swift's 2019 song \"Cruel Summer\". A psychedelic pop, pop rock, art pop, and indie pop song, \"Deja Vu\" sees Rodrigo interrogate a former lover, who is pursuing a different relationship, about his d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when his behavior with his new love-interest evokes the things he used to do with Rodrigo. Like its predecessor, the song received acclaim from music critics. The accompanying music video is set in Malibu, California, and depicts the subject's new girlfriend, played by Talia Ryder, mimicking all of Rodrigo's styles and habits.\n\"Deja Vu\" debuted at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100, marking the second consecutive single from Sour to enter the top ten of the chart, after \"Drivers License\"; Rodrigo also became the first artist in history to debut their first two singles inside the top ten of the Hot 100. It rose to its peak of number three on the chart after the release of Sour, becoming her third top three single. Elsewhere, the single reached the top-ten in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Latvia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Background and promotion ==\nRodrigo signed to Geffen Records, a subsidiary of Interscope Records, intending to release her debut EP in 2021. She co-wrote the song \"Drivers License\" with its producer Daniel Nigro, and released it as her debut single in January 2021, to commercial success. Billboard magazine declared it as one of the \"most dominant\" hits in Hot 100 history.Rodrigo began teasing a follow-up single by wiping her Instagram account and posting cryptic teasers of it on her social media accounts in late March 2021; on March 29, she announced that it would be titled \"Deja Vu\", and set a release date of three days later, reassuring fans that the announcement was not an April Fools' Day joke. Rodrigo unveiled the song's artwork in the same post. Rodrigo posted three cryptic flickering clips preceding the announcement, featuring a melting ice cream cone, drifting clouds, and a car being driven along the ocean, which was interpreted as a reference to \"Deja Vu\"'s lyrics by Nylon's Steffanee Wang. In an interview with MTV News, Rodrigo stated that the song was \"definitely not like 'Drivers License' at all\", and was excited and nervous about her audience viewing a different aspect of her artistry on it. Furthermore, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Rodrigo mentioned that the song's bridge was influenced by \"Cruel Summer\", a song by Swift from her seventh studio album, Lover (2019).\n\n\n== Composition and reception ==\n\n\"Deja Vu\" was written and recorded in late 2020. It has been described as an ethereal midtempo psychedelic pop, pop rock, art pop, and indie pop song while other sources observe alternative influences. It contains lyrics revolving around heartbreak. On \"Deja Vu\", Rodrigo addresses a past partner who is currently pursuing a different relationship and recalls how he is repeating things he did with Rodrigo, with the new girl as well, which are activities such as driving up the California coast, eating strawberry ice cream, trading jackets, watching reruns of the Fox musical dramedy Glee, and listening to \"Uptown Girl\" (1983) by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel. In July 2021, Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff and St. Vincent were credited as co-writers of \"Deja Vu\", officially pertaining to the interpolation of Swift's 2019 song \"Cruel Summer\".\"Deja Vu\" was met with critical acclaim upon release. \nQuinn Moreland of Pitchfork stated that with \"Deja Vu\", Rodrigo has proven to be \"pop music's next heavyweight\", complimenting the song's \"delightfully ensnaring\" production and deemed it a \"sassy\" and \"bittersweet catharsis\". Tom Breihan of Stereogum commended its stylistic change of pace from \"Drivers License\", describing it as a \"giddy, stomping pop banger with a euphoric-singalong chorus\", although he also noted its similar subject matter. Tatiana Tenreyro of The A.V. Club lauded the track as an improvement over her debut single, stating that \"Deja Vu is a stunning, twinkly track that feels like a marriage between Taylor Swift and Radiohead\".\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Deja Vu\" debuted at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, making Rodrigo the first artist in history to debut her first two singles in the top ten of the Hot 100. Following the release of Sour, the song jumped to its peak of number three on the chart dated June 5, 2021, and remained in the top ten for the next 13 weeks. The song spent 29 weeks on the chart. Similarly, \"Deja Vu\" peaked at number two on the Billboard's Mainstream Top 40 chart, retaining the position for four weeks. It was kept off of the top spot by Rodrigo's follow-up single, \"Good 4 U\".\nIn the United Kingdom, the single debuted at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart after its first full tracking week. Following the release of its parent album, the song reached a new peak of number 4 on the chart. In Ireland, \"Deja Vu\" reached number two on its Irish Singles Chart.In Australia, \"Deja Vu\" launched at number 13 after its first full tracking week, then climbed to number 6 three weeks after, scoring Rodrigo her second top 10 song in the country. Upon Sour's release, \"Deja Vu\" reached a new peak of number 3.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nBefore \"Deja Vu\" was released, Rodrigo went onto YouTube and MTV for premiering her new single, and said that they shot the music video of \"Deja Vu\" in Malibu. The music video was directed by Allie Avital. It featured an appearance by actress Talia Ryder. The video first depicts Olivia after getting her drivers license, with her right hand holding ice cream and her left hand on the steering wheel, as she drives up the Pacific Coast Highway to a house. Another girl flashes in the rear-view mirror. At the house, she peers in the window, and smiles at the girl inside who is wearing a green dress, apparently reminiscing. Olivia drives back to her home and puts on the same green dress. She goes into a room with many TVs stacked up on each other, playing VHS tapes of her memories being reenacted by the girl she just saw. Eventually, the girl turns to the camera and waves at Olivia who realizes she was being used by her ex-boyfriend to replace the other girl all along. In a rage, Olivia proceeds to smash the TVs with a hammer except one showing the other girl in the car lip-syncing the words, \"I know you get deja vu.\" The end scene shows the beginning scene except the other girl is driving and not Olivia.As of January 2022, the song has 200 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Sour and Tidal.Studio locations\n\nPersonnel\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Need to Know\" is a song by American rapper and singer Doja Cat. It was initially released through Kemosabe and RCA Records on June 11, 2021, as the sole promotional single from her third studio album, Planet Her, and impacted American rhythmic contemporary radio stations on August 31, 2021, as the third single from the record. It was written by Doja Cat and producer Dr. Luke. \nCommercially, the song reached the top 10 in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the United States. It was nominated for Best Melodic Rap Performance at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. The accompanying music video explores the nightlife environment of the fictional \"Planet Her\" and features cameo appearances from Canadian musician Grimes and American actress Ryan Destiny. Vulture named it the best song of 2021.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nIn April 2021, the song was confirmed after being briefly mentioned during a cover story interview with Billboard. On June 9, 2021, Doja Cat officially announced the release of \"Need to Know\" with a futuristic teaser for the song's music video on her social media accounts, with the faint melody of the song briefly heard in the short clip. Shortly after the teaser was published, Doja Cat noted in a tweet that the song \"isn't even the next single\" and that it was \"just some shit before the next more important single comes out for you to enjoy.\" The song was officially released on all streaming platforms on June 11, 2021, with its corresponding music video being released sixteen hours later. Shortly before the song's release, Doja Cat had officially announced the release of the parent album Planet Her and revealed its track listing and album art. In July 2021, she performed the song in a pre-recorded video for Vevo. \"Need to Know\" impacted rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States, as the album's third single on August 31, 2021.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\n\"Need to Know\" is a trap-pop song with elements of melodic rap, bass-heavy R&B, and disco. Written by Doja Cat and its producer Dr. Luke, the song was described as a \"grinding sex jam\" driven by a \"crisp\" rhythm of \"vital trap snares\", \"tacky\" reversed hi-hats, and \"sharp\" drums, over \"a hard-knocking bass\" and atmospheric, \"neon-lit\", futuristic synthesizers. She claims to have been inebriated while writing the song in studio. Doja Cat delivers her \"usual blend of ethereal vocals and melodically harsh raps\" as well as \"shrill\" background vocals. Lyrically, she explores her pursuit of a new love interest or sexual partner whilst trying to determine if they have mutual agreement and understanding. A celebration of sexuality, the lyrics find Doja Cat fantasizing about her sexual desires.The song was considered distinguishable by its \"raunchy\" lyrics in which she describes her \"bedroom antics\". Some critics described it as \"seductive\" and \"fiery\", noting that Doja Cat \"turns up the heat\" and \"takes it to the bedroom\". Paris Close of iHeartRadio noted that she delivers \"a salvo of erotic verses nonstop, only stopping to catch her breath in soft, sensual whispers and climactic coos.\" Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone noted that Doja Cat's rap verses \"lean into delightfully lurid punchlines\". Imogen Lawlor wrote that her \"dense triplet flow is layered over futuristic disco production, segueing seamlessly into a disjunct, electronic UFO melody emphasising the space theme of the release.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nVulture crowned \"Need to Know\" as the best song of 2021 and deemed it \"really the best showcase of all the talents [Doja Cat]'s possessed for years\", praising her \"vocal contortionism\" and \"overflowing charisma\". In an album review for Uproxx, Bianca Gracie crowned \"Need to Know\" as the best song on Planet Her and described it as \"an otherworldly joyride driven by the mad scientist that is Doja Cat. She's in true alien form here: a raunchy freak, cooing baby, helium sucker, and frantic spitter over a galaxy of ice-cold trap melodies.\" Meaghan Garvey of Billboard noted that the record celebrates Doja Cat's femininity and revels in her sense of humor. Writing for the same magazine, Jason Lipshutz noted that \"Need to Know\" is \"rife with thinly veiled innuendos and sexual demands\" and that it \"features one of Doja Cat's most liberated vocal performances -- singing, rapping, pleading, crooning, remaining singular in her delivery and utterly fearless on the microphone.\" In Billboard's review of the album, Kyle Denis deemed the song \"a prime example of how Doja doesn't solely rely on the shock value of her lyrics to make her songs click; the theatricality of her delivery and vocal performances are what truly carry this song and the rest of Planet Her.\"\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\nThe music video was filmed in May 2021, directed by duo Miles Cable & AJ Favicchio with support from their production company SixTwentySix Productions, the music video takes place in the futuristic city environment of the fictional \"Planet Her\" and follows a blue-tinted alien Doja Cat alongside a group of female alien friends played by actresses Jazelle Straka-Braxton and Josephine Pearl Leewhich with cameo appearances from Canadian musician Grimes and American actress Ryan Destiny.The video opens with the camera flying through a 3D-animated, futuristic cityscape before settling on a scenic shot of Doja Cat playing video games in her underwear while drinking and lounging around with her group of friends. The scene changes to the group inside a flying \"self-driving convertible pod\" Uber. They arrive at a private, underground club hosting a variety of cyborgs and aliens where the group dances and take shots of smoky vapor-like alcohol. She begins to flirt with a man whom she shares a dance with before giving him a lap dance in a private room. Towards the end of the video they return to the dancefloor before parting ways outside the club. Doja Cat whispers something into the man's ear which makes his eyes light up, before the video suddenly ends, thus suggesting an open ending. Writers at Billboard begged the question \"Is he an alien? Or is he human?\", to which Doja Cat indirectly responded on Twitter that he was a cyborg pretending to be human.Miles & AJ revealed that Doja Cat and her team came up with the concept for the video and maintained creative control. Referring to Grimes, The A.V. Club noted that \"given the futuristic nature of the music video, it only makes sense to bring in an artist who seems like they're from another planet.\" Grimes revealed that she agreed to take part in the video without even asking what it was beforehand, writing that the shoot was \"insanely fun\". Doja Cat and her directors used Blade Runner (1982) and The Fifth Element (1997) as reference points while creating the music video. The set for the music video was built by production designer Jonathan Chu, as opposed to the conventional usage of a green screen. Doja Cat's creative team hired Melissa Stearn to do prosthetics for the video, while the animators used Unreal Engine to render the introductory cityscape sequence. Ana Diaz of Polygon compared Doja Cat's alien persona to Aayla Secura from the Star Wars franchise.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"My Universe\" is an English and Korean song by British rock band Coldplay and South Korean pop group BTS. It was released on 24 September 2021, through Parlophone and Atlantic Records, as the second official single from Music of the Spheres, the former group's ninth studio album. It debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming BTS' sixth US chart-topper and Coldplay's second after 2008's \"Viva la Vida\". The single is also the first track by two co-billed lead groups to top the chart and the first song by a British group to debut at number one in the United States' history.\"My Universe\" has been positively received by critics. It premiered at number three in the UK Singles Chart, claiming the second-biggest week of the year in downloads, and eventually becoming the most downloaded song of 2021 by a group in the country. The track also reached number one in Hungary, Malaysia and Singapore; the top ten in Australia, Belgium, Canada, India, Ireland, and South Korea; and the top twenty of twelve other countries, including Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, and New Zealand. \nThe official music video, directed by Dave Meyers, was released on 30 September 2021 and features both groups performing on different futuristic planets (Floris, Calypso, and Supersolis) alongside a fictional band named \"Supernova 7\" via the \"HOLOBAND\" technology developed by DJ Lafrique, set in an era where music is banned around the universe.\n\n",

A snippet of the song was included in a trailer titled \"Overtura\", also omitting any evidence of the Korean group being involved. On 13 September 2021, the song was revealed to be a collaboration between Coldplay and BTS. The single was announced through a coded message on Coldplay's Alien Radio FM social media account. Following the release of the \"Permission to Dance\" music video in early July 2021, the groups first collaborated during an episode of the YouTube series Released, during which they joined a discussion with Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin on what inspired the \"#PermissionToDance Challenge\". However, speculations about a collaboration between the two groups had already started circulating in February 2021, after BTS covered their 2005 hit song \"Fix You\" on MTV Unplugged. On 26 September, the Inside My Universe making-of documentary of the song was released, alongside a \"Supernova 7\" remix and an acoustic version. A third remix, done by Suga of BTS, was released on 18 October. Additional remixes by Galantis and David Guetta were released in November.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nA space-themed lyric video, featuring animated handwritten lyrics from both bands in English and Korean, was released together with the song on 24 September 2021. Additional visualizers for the instrumental and three remix versions of the track were published in the following days.A music video directed by Dave Meyers was released on 30 September 2021. Set in the Spheres planetary system, where music has been banned by the \"Silencers\", who appeared in Coldplay's 2011 album Mylo Xyloto. The video depicts Coldplay, BTS, and the fictional alien band Supernova 7 performing \"My Universe\" together. Though located on different planets, the three groups are united as holograms through \"HOLOBAND\" technology controlled by alien DJ Lafrique, who broadcasts their performance throughout the system from her radio ship while being hunted by the Silencers. Coldplay filmed the video at an empty, abandoned municipal swimming pool complex in Rub\u00ed, Barcelona, in July 2021. The BTS portion was shot on a green-screen stage at a studio in Seoul, South Korea, two weeks after the Barcelona shoot. The green screen was useful to make the visual effects, such as the groups' holographic versions, and to unite the scenes from both groups.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nOn 23 September 2021, a day before the song was officially released, Coldplay performed \"My Universe\" on Pandora's Small Stage Series at the Apollo Theater in New York City. Chris Martin performed a short acoustic rendition of the song as a preview during his guest appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, which aired the following day. On 25 September, the band performed the song at the Global Citizen Festival in New York's Central Park, with BTS appearing virtually via a pre-recorded video that played onscreen behind them. Martin also attempted to sing some of BTS' Korean verses. The following month, the band performed the song during their guest appearance on The Graham Norton Show on 15 October, at the 2021 Earthshot Prize ceremony at Alexandra Palace in London two days later (in which 60 cyclists pedalling on bikes provided the power for their performance), and as part of their closing set for Audacy's 8th annual We Can Survive charity concert held at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on 23 October.\nColdplay and BTS performed \"My Universe\" for the first time together at the 2021 American Music Awards on 21 November at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. On 2 December, Martin joined BTS to perform the song at the latter's Permission to Dance on Stage concert at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nRhian Daly from NME gave the song a positive review of four stars out of five and called it \"a celestial ode to unity, hope and the power of love\". She also noted that while some might view the track as an unusual pairing, the two acts joining forces \"makes complete sense\" because \"both share a predilection for a poetic and heartfelt approach to their music; as well as being two of the biggest bands in the world, they are also two of modern pop's deepest thinkers, imbuing their lyrics with touching statements on love and life.\"\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nThe song received five non-consecutive weekly Melon Popularity Awards in South Korea.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nCD single\n\nMy Universe \u2013 3:50\nMy Universe (instrumental) \u2013 3:49\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications and sales ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Billboard Global 200 number ones of 2021\nList of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 2021\nList of Billboard Hot 100 number-ones by British artists\nList of number-one songs of 2021 (Malaysia)\nList of number-one songs of 2021 (Singapore)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Happier Than Ever\" is a song by American singer Billie Eilish. The song was released as the sixth single of Eilish's album of the same name on July 30, 2021, through Darkroom and Interscope Records. She teased it on April 26, along with a 15-second long snippet and its title. The song received widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike, with many praising the song's mid-way transition from an acoustic strummed guitar ballad to an emphatic punk rock infused ending. At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards the song received four nominations, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAmerican singer Billie Eilish released the second single from her second studio album Happier Than Ever, \"Therefore I Am\", in November 2020. She confirmed she was working on the album that month and that she had 16 tracks in the works, and cited the COVID-19 pandemic as an inspiration on its content. The song \"Happier Than Ever\" was first used in the 2021 documentary film Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry, where its lyrics \"when I'm away from you, I'm happier than ever, wish I could explain it better. Wish it wasn't true\" were revealed.Eilish teased an upcoming musical release in April 2021, posting \"things are comingggg\", on her Instagram account. One week later, on April 26, she released a 15-second long snippet of the song on her Instagram account, in the visuals of which she sits in a chair with her back to the camera. DIY described the clip as \"stripped-back\", speculating that it is \"welcoming Billie's brand new era\". It serves as the title track and sixth single from the album, released alongside the album on July 30, 2021.Eilish described the song: \"It was probably the most therapeutic song I've ever written or recorded, like ever, ever, ever, 'cause I just screamed my lungs out and could barely talk afterwards, which was very satisfying to me somehow. I had wanted to get those screams out for a very long time and it was very nice to.\"\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe sheet music for \"Happier Than Ever\" was published in the key of C major. It is set in the time signature of 44 in the first half, with a tempo of 90 beats per minute and then transitions to 68 midway through the song, with a tempo of 81 beats per minute. Eilish's vocal range spans from E3 to C5.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe track received widespread critical acclaim. Vulture's Justin Curto wrote that \"Happier Than Ever\" transitions \"from a gently strummed ballad to a monstrous rock scorcher\". David Smyth of Evening Standard named it as a \"jazzy acoustic soul\" song, while Rolling Stone's Angie Martoccio called it as \"cathartic pop-punk\". Writing for Harper's Bazaar, Bianca Betancourt agreed the song is an \"emotional ballad\".\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video was released on the same day as the song. In it, Eilish walks back and forth in a glamorous room and performs the song into a telephone, likely speaking to the person mentioned in the song. Midway, as the song transforms, lights start to flicker. Confused, Eilish opens the door and water rushes into the room. The clip ends \"cathartically\" as Eilish is dancing on the roof in the middle of a downpour, and at the end of the video, she submerges into the water. According to Betancourt, Eilish \"narrates her disappointment with a partner via a vintage landline telephone and looms the end of their relationship\". Curto considered it \"a flood of emotion to match that glorious guitar breakdown\".\n\n\n== Cover versions ==\nCanadian singer Shawn Mendes covered \"Happier Than Ever\" in BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge on September 14, 2021. On September 30, 2021, American singer Kelly Clarkson covered an abridged version of the song on her talk show.  The pianist, composer and YouTuber Nahre Sol has also covered the song by reimagining it as if classical composers (Mozart, Chopin, Schubert, Rachmaninoff, Erik Satie and herself) had written it, in her video \"Billie Eilish\u2019s Happier Than Ever, Reimagined by 5 Classical Composers\"]. Singer ASTN posted a cover of the song on YouTube on November 3 that quickly became popular on TikTok and YouTube.In November 2021, Eilish collaborated with Sesame Workshop to create a child-friendly rendition of the song for Sesame Street in order to help children count to two. The cover was sung by Billie Eilish and Count von Count, a vampire Muppet character on Sesame Street performed by Matt Vogel. The cover runs 1 minute and 31 seconds, containing re-written lyrics from the beginning chorus, half of the first verse, and the ending chorus.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Heartbreak Anniversary\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Giveon. It was released on February 21, 2020, as the second single from his debut EP, Take Time (2020). Written from the perspective of a friend of Giveon's, the downtempo piano ballad finds him singing about the date of a breakup, reminiscing and grieving about a love gone wrong. The song became a sleeper hit, garnering chart success in early 2021, with a music video subsequently being released, and the song was sent to US radio, in March 2021. It reached number one in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\"Heartbreak Anniversary\" was also included on Giveon's compilation album, When It's All Said and Done... Take Time, released in March 2021. The song has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\n\n== Background and writing ==\n\"Heartbreak Anniversary\" was written by Giveon from the perspective of someone else, as Giveon explained: \"I was talking to a friend, and they told me they broke up with their significant other exactly a year ago, and I was like, 'Oh, alright, I'm going to write a song about that'\". In an interview with Billboard, Giveon said that he drew further inspiration from how he copes with a day that continues to bring many \"lovesick\" memories every year. He stated, So \"Heartbreak  Anniversary\" is just the anniversary of a heartbreak. Say you guys are heartbroken on Valentine's Day, February 14th. Every time Valentine's Day comes around you kinda revisit the pain and revisit the sorrow. So with this song, I tried to make pain sound beautiful.\n\"Heartbreak  Anniversary\" was released on Giveon's birthday. In early 2021, the song went viral on the video-sharing app, TikTok. By March 15, 2021, the song had surpassed 143 million streams, including 97 million streams on Spotify.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nOn \"Heartbreak  Anniversary\", Giveon sings about the day his heart was broken, reminiscing about every detail, and the pain that comes with heartbreak. He appears emotional and vulnerable, \"foolishly\" hoping that his ex lover will return. Musically, Giveon delivers soaring vocals over a largely piano and percussion-based  \nmid-tempo electro and soul merged instrumental. Apple Music noted how he creates \"harmonies with himself that render a simple line like 'Don't want to let you out my head' as gospel\". Rolling Stone's Elias Leight labeled the song \"a swelling, disconsolate ballad built around mournful piano and gnarled guitars. Giveon's vocals on the song was compared to that of Frank Sinatra, but \"with an R&B flavour and a young fresh take on the Rat Pack style\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nMilcah P. of HotNewHipHop  called the song \"enchanting\", further stating: \"The cut is characterized by a seamless mixture of Giveon's signature baritone and flawless falsettos. It's a wonderful display of range and composition and easily has Giveon pegged as one to watch within the R&B realm\". Writing for Manila Bulletin, Punch Liwanag said the track \"is the best representation of who and what Giv\u0113on is all about, at least for the time being\". Uproxx's Wongo Okon called it a standout from Take Time. Similarly, Billboard's Carl Lamarre said \"Highlights [on Take Time] like 'Heartbreak Anniversary' and 'Favorite Mistake' showcase his penchant for pensive lyrics and moody soundscapes\". Pitchfork named the song among their \"Pitchfork Selects\" playlist for the week of March 22, 2021. NPR's Sidney Madden included the song in their Heat Check feature for February 2021, noting the wishful lyrics: \"being 'foolishly patient' will serve you no good here. This is the type of firmly rooted pain that only twists deeper\".\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe official video was released on March 12, 2021, over a year after the single's release. It was directed by Salomon Ligthelm, and released on the same day as Giveon's compilation, When It's All Said and Done... Take Time. The \"aesthetically pleasing\" visual finds Giveon grieving and reflecting on the good and bad times he had with his ex lover, played by Samantha Logan. He is seen transitioning between his \"lonely present and his turbulent past\".\nIn a May 2020 interview with Billboard, Giveon said he could see himself making a short film or story out of the song, because it has \"so much depth [...] and a lot of stuff that wasn't told in the song. 'Heartbreak Anniversary' just talks about the break-up. It doesn't talk about what led to the break-up\".\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe song initially broke out in Southeast Asia, reaching number one on the Spotify charts in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, and the top 10 of various other countries. It has been certified 3x Platinum by the RIAA for units of over 3,000,000 in the US.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Billboard.\nGiveon \u2013 vocals, songwriter, composer\nSevn Thomas \u2013 songwriter, composer, production\nManeesh Bidaye \u2013 songwriter, composer, production\nVarren Wade \u2013 songwriter, composer\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one songs of 2021 (Malaysia)\nList of number-one songs of 2021 (Singapore)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Heartbreak Anniversary\" official audio on YouTube\nGiveon \"Heartbreak Anniversary\" Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified via Genius on YouTube",

            "\"Love Again\" is a song by English singer Dua Lipa from her second studio album Future Nostalgia (2020). The song was written by Lipa alongside Clarence Coffee Jr., Chelcee Grimes and its producer Koz. They wrote the song based on the concept of manifesting positive things into one's life. \"Love Again\" is a classically-sounding dance-pop, disco and electropop song with a 21st century nu-disco production that includes Eurodisco beats and 1970s-styled disco strings. The lyrics explore themes of heartbreak and personal growth. They see Lipa falling in love again with a new lover following a rough split. The song samples \"My Woman\" (1932) by Al Bowlly with Lew Stone and His Monseigneur Band, with its strings, horn and trumpet, thus Bing Crosby, Max Wartell and Irving Wallman are also credited as writers.\nDescribed by Lipa as her favourite song on the album, \"Love Again\" was sent for radio airplay in France on 11 March 2021 as the sixth and final single from Future Nostalgia before being released for digital download and streaming on 4 June 2021 globally. Several music critics praised the use of the \"My Woman\" sample as well as the strings used in its production and the lyrics. Commercially, the song reached number 59 on the Billboard Global 200 chart while also reaching number 51 on the UK Singles Chart and number 41 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It additionally reached the top 10 of charts in Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, where it reached the summit. The song is certified silver in the United Kingdom and platinum in Italy and Poland.\nThe music video for \"Love Again\" was directed by Lope Serrano of Spanish production team Canada and filmed at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London. The visual sees Lipa and her rodeo clown-styled dancers in the hotel's ballroom line dancing, riding mechanical bulls that sometimes disappear and painting eggs. A horse appears and the rodeo clowns attempt to saddle a giant egg. Several critics commended the video's message of it being silly to fall in love so soon, as well as its Western style and surrealism.

The song was included on the setlist of Lipa's 2022 Future Nostalgia Tour. It was further promoted with remixes by Horse Meat Disco, Imanbek and Garabatto.\n\n\n== Writing and production ==\n\n\"Love Again\" was written by Lipa and her longtime collaborators Clarence Coffee Jr., Chelcee Grimes, and Stephen Kozmeniuk. They began working on the song while Lipa was going through a rough patch with a breakup. She had been in a relationship with someone who had been dishonest to her and realized it was no longer healthy for her. During the relationship, Lipa didn't recognize herself and felt as though she had lost her power, as she usually sees herself as a strong woman. The collaborators had been working together in the studio for a couple days, but they hadn't written anything they liked. Lipa was running late to that studio that day, while Kozmeniuk came in early determined to make something cool. With her second studio album Future Nostalgia, Lipa wanted to create \"old-styled\" music with a modern twist, being inspired by artists that she grew up listening to. Having known that, Kozmeniuk played with some analog synths and came up with a rudimentary chord progression. He then added a guitar riff on top and a drum break throughout the song. Acoustic guitars were then added. When Lipa arrived at the studio, Grimes and Coffee were playing the guitar and singing \"Hotdamn, you got me in love again\". Lipa quickly rejected the line and changed it to \"Goddamn, you got me in love again\". She began expressing her feelings about the relationship to the writers, and Coffee suggested writing about that. They decided to begin the song with a concept of manifesting positive energy into ones life and realizing some things need to end. Lipa thought that if she wrote about this, she might feel better. They started writing \"Love Again\" on a guitar and the song was originally in a non-standard song structure, which Lipa was fine with. Lipa thought the version felt good.\n\nFollowing the session, Kozmeniuk was reading a Studio 54 book and he was picturing the work of Donna Summer where she had build with a lot of drums before and string part and then the song. Inspired by this, he got his neighbor, Drew Jurecka, to play the violin and strings. Kozmeniuk quickly sent the string version to Lipa, which she expressed her admiration for how dramatic it was. However, all the collaborators agreed that the song was still missing something. Later, two beats were added to the middle eight to build for a string part before exploding with the chorus. One night while they were all in a studio, Coffee began singing the riff of the 1932 track \"My Woman\" by Al Bowlly with Lew Stone and His Monseigneur Band over the top of what they had. Lipa thought the riff was from Star Wars, while Grimes thought it was eerie and spooky. Lipa then suggested that they should incorporate it into \"Love Again\". Kozmeniuk spent a lot of time doing so with several different pitch corrections as \"Love Again\" and \"My Woman\" were in different keys. Due to this, Bing Crosby, Max Wartell and Irving Wallman were credited as writers. Coffee and Grimes questioned Lipa on including the line \"I'll sink my teeth in disbelief\" but Lipa fought really hard for it. She described it as a visual line where you can almost taste how good something is, like the rush of adrenaline when she is about to get on stage. The line was originally \"don't wake me up if it's a dream\".Lipa's vocals were recorded at RAK Studios in London. She went to the studio with her vocal producer Lorna Blackwood. Blackwood told Lipa to sing the sad parts of the song with a smile. Lipa recorded the ad libs last which she was nervous for thinking she would go off pitch. However, the nerves went away as the booth is like a school bathroom with great acoustics where anything sounds great. Other vocals were recorded at TaP Studio and Sleeper Sound, both in London. The song was recorded at the Windmill in Norfolk, Modulator Music in Toronto and Sleeper Sound. Mixing was handled by Matty Green at Studio 55 in Los Angeles while Chris Gehringer mastered the song at Sterling Sound in Edgewater, New Jersey. Lipa described \"Love Again\" as \"dance crying\" as it is a dance song with the juxtaposition of both happy and sad feelings. As the song was written in parts instead of a complete track, there were several different versions of it. At one point Lipa suggested making the current middle eight the chorus, but quickly went demo version. After the song was finished, the collaborators spent a lot of time getting the structure right and playing with the arrangements, right up until the final mix. The first demo of the song featured new wave synths and a ska guitar. Lipa described \"Love Again\" as her favourite song on Future Nostalgia.\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n\"Love Again\" is a dance-pop, disco and electropop song with a classic sound. The song has a length of 4:18, and a structure of verse, bridge, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, bridge, middle eight, bridge, chorus. It is composed in the time signature of 44 time and the key of F\u266f minor, with a tempo of 116 beats per minute and a chord progression of F\u266fm\u2013D\u2013Bm7\u2013E. The song's melodramatic 21st-century nu-disco production matches its lyrics, and includes gloopy violins, orchestral sounds, acoustic guitars, Eurodisco beats, and disco synths. Swooning, stirring, and buzzing 1970s disco strings are also included, which add an emotional edge to the lyrics. Acoustic guitar strums are included in the echoing bridge, before a repetitive hook and a thudding beat drop. The song samples \"My Woman\" (1932) by Al Bowlly with Lew Stone and His Monseigneur Band. These elements are featured in the intro and woven in and out throughout the song. This sample includes items that make up its chord progression and much of its melody, including its strings, horn, and trumpet, the latter of which was made popular by its sample in White Town's 1997 song \"Your Woman\".Lipa uses her lower register husky vocals that encapsulate an undeniable sense of urgency, as if she is mimicking the rush of falling in love with hints of tension ever so often. Her vocals range from the low note of E3 to the high note of A4. Lyrically, \"Love Again\" explores themes of heartbreak and personal growth with proclamations of rediscovered love and the hateful romantic rediscovering of the power of love. Lipa expresses her powerlessness in a new relationship, and explains how terrifying it can be. After a falling out with the belief in love, she navigates her feelings after being unexpectedly swept off her feet by a new partner following a rough split with a previous lover. She attempts to open her heart once again after the betrayal and loneliness she experienced. Lipa knows how a new love could end, but is faithful and open to what the future might bring. Lipa additionally described it as one manifesting good things into their lives when things aren't going their way. The song quotes the chorus melody of \"Don't Cha\" (2005) by the Pussycat Dolls.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\n\"Love Again\" was released through Warner Records on 27 March 2020 as the eighth track on Lipa's second studio album Future Nostalgia. A lyric video for it was released on 9 April 2020. A remix of the song by Horse Meat Disco is apart on Lipa and the Blessed Madonna's 28 August 2020-released, DJ Mix-crafted remix album Club Future Nostalgia, while the original version of the remix was released for digital download and streaming on 11 September 2020. It is a 1980s-styled, percussion and synth-heavy remix that introduces simple melodies, funk-laced instrumentals, and strutting beats with a squelchy, retro charm; although, the \"My Woman\" sample is no longer heard. The song was the subject of a Song Exploder volume 2 episode on Netflix, released on 15 December 2020.\"Love Again\" was promoted to radios in France on 11 March 2021 as the sixth single from Future Nostalgia. The song was released for digital download and streaming globally on 4 June 2021. Nina Braca of Billboard noted that this release, fifteen months following the release of the album, was \"practically unheard of\" in modern music era as \"album cycles often come and go in as little as a few weeks\". The song was sent for radio airplay in Italy on 11 June 2021. On 22 June 2021, it was promoted to contemporary hit, adult contemporary and dance radio in the United States as a promotional single. The song was officially sent to contemporary hit radio in the country on 6 July and adult contemporary radio on 26 July 2021. It was promoted with two more remixes: the 1 October 2021-released Imanbek remix and the 15 October 2021-released Garabatto remix.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nElly Watson of DIY praised the use of the \"My Woman\" sample, calling them \"goosebump-inducing,\" while musicOMH's Nick Smith stated they has a \"slapping effect.\" Smith went on to call the song a \"highlight\" and compared it to Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Writing for Stereogum, Chris DeVille thought the song was reminiscent of Vicki Sue Robinson's \"Turn the Beat Around\"(1976), while Jeffrey Davies' review for Spectrum Culture saw him compare it to \"I Feel Love\" (1977) by Donna Summer. The Independent's Helen Brown thought that the song has Lipa's best use of a sample with the \"My Woman\" sample. She also named it Lipa's \"most romantic song\" to date, while David Levesley's GQ review saw him calling the song her \"most powerfully pro-love song to date.\" Nylon writer Steffanee Wang viewed the song as a \"Western movie's take on the feverish emotion\" of love.Jonathan Wright of God Is in the TV commended the \"excellent\" use of the \"My Woman\" sample, as well as complimenting the string arrangement and middle eight. In her review for The Guardian, Laura Snapes complimented Lipa for being awestruck in the song. Slant Magazine ranked \"Love Again\" as 2020's 25th best song, and writer Sal Cinquemani praised it for demonstrating \"Lipa's knack for wringing pathos from everyday dating woes and pouring it into sublime dance-pop.\" He additionally viewed the song as \"euphoric\" and a \"dizzying dance-floor filler.\" Writing for Crack Magazine, Michael Cragg thought that the song is a \"sky-scraping ballad\" that transforms into a \"sophisticated, dancefloor-ready bop.\" From her review in Billboard, Bianca Gracie saw that the use of strings add a \"jolt of nostalgia,\" while the lyrics see Lipa in an \"out-of-body love experience.\" Overall, she named it Future Nostalgia's sixth best track and one of the album's sultrier moments.Mike Nied of Idolator commended Lipa's \"dulcet\" vocals, stating they work well for this song. He continued by noting its contrast to her single \"Don't Start Now\" (2019) as well as viewing \"Love Again\" as a vulnerable moment. For Business Insider, Callie Ahlgrim thought that Lipa's vocals \"shine\" on the track, while also calling it \"cinematic.\" In a negative review from PopMatters, Nick Malone stated that the hook doesn't \"pop\" the way it needs to, Lipa's vocals are \"non-committal,\" and the \"My Woman\" sample does not make it \"soar.\" In a separate review for the same magazine, Evan Sawdey commended the \"clever\" use of the \"My Woman\" sample, stating it makes the song \"stand out.\" In April 2020, Christopher Rosa of Glamour ranked it as Lipa's sixth best song, viewing it as the album's most \"overtly disco\" track and \"grandiose ode to falling in love against your better wishes.\"\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nUpon Future Nostalgia's release, \"Love Again\" became a relatively successful album track across Europe.

Lipa contacted the production company for another collaboration following the video for her 2020 single \"Physical\". They were briefed with information that Lipa pictured herself on a mechanical bull for the video, it was her favourite song on the album and that the song was about a personal resurgence, not necessarily just in a romantic context. When writing the video, Canada attempted to gather real and predictable rodeo elements and combine them in unexpected ways. The production team found new meanings the rodeo elements to communicate in the video, including using the clown makeup for abstract painting strains so classical paintings could be used to connect shots. They used paintings that depicted horses, romantic raptures, hugs, portraits and hyperdynamic group compositions. Serrano decided to add egg aspects to the video as he was looking for \"an unexpected rhyme to the lasso routine\". He thought that the wrist movement when one beats eggs is similar to a lasso movement. He also wanted to illustrate the song's romantic message, like the idea of \"an unexpected love that appears again, something so pure and intense that seems to be only possible once in a lifetime, like these delicate flowers or animals that are just designed to blossom and intercourse just once and then they die\" as well as the \"tense connection between the humans and their recovered feelings\".\n\nThe visual was filmed at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London about three weeks before its release, during rehearsals for Lipa's performance at the 41st Brit Awards. Serrano liked the idea of shooting in one place as it adds to the video's cohesiveness and makes it as though the characters are real and belong to the setting. The video's team quarantined in the hotel for a week before they began filming due to restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This gave the team time to work in the location. Lipa learned the video's choreography in 45 minutes and new outfits were added for her in the midst of filming. Serrano recalled that she enjoyed being on the mechanical bull that was controlled. Steve Dent helped the team with the horse and production company Eighty4 helped with the VFX, making it so that when the horse went invisible, there was still a 3D aspect with the saddle and rider. These shots were the hardest to shoot so the team worked with the tension of the ropes attached to the horse's neck as well as adjusting the natural shadow of the horse.Lipa formally announced the video on 31 May 2021. It premiered on YouTube on 4 June 2021. A director's cut version of the video was released on 28 July 2021. This version features an opening of two rodeo clowns reading a script, that is lyrics of \"Love Again\", more classical paintings in the editing, less dancing, more shots of the rodeo clowns, a chicken on the TV set, Lipa riding the lighting horse as well as final credits that feature a rodeo clown riding the horse which has a green suit on.\n\n\n=== Analysis and synopsis ===\n\nThe video opens with two title cards saying Lipa's name and the song title, \"Love Again\". The visual starts out with a cowboy hat floating from a coat room to a ballroom where Lipa catches it and puts it on her head. She wears a zebra print bikini top, belted black denim shorts, a suede vest, a cowboy hat, a bolo tie and chunky heeled boots while riding a mechanical bull; this bull later becomes invisible as a way to make things less emphatic and literal. Intercut scenes of her riding the bull covered in LED lights and wearing a Phipps cowboy suit containing a green top, blue pants and a cowboy hat, also covered in LEDS, are also included, as well as her floating in slow motion while wearing Blumarine pink bandana crop top with a lacy trim, a lavender hat, a butterfly belt buckle with diamant\u00e9s, blue denim pants and hot pink cowboy boots. She later waves a glowing lasso in the former scene. The singer is also seen cracking eggs with different coloured yolks to later whisk them in another room while rodeo clowns do the same and paint clown faces on each other with the coloured yolks while also making omelettes. She wears a red-and-black denim set from a collaboration between Levi and Miu Miu with a leather jacket from the latter company's 2011 line.Back in the ballroom, Lipa square dances and line dances with rodeo clowns as the floor is covered in eggs. She wears Rick Owens grill kiss leather boots, camo green cargo pants, a longline brown cow print jacket and a cow-print bra; the latter three clothing items are from The Attico. Some of the rodeo clowns also appear on invisible horses. Further on, a giant egg floats in the middle of the ballroom and the rodeo clowns attempt to capture it with lassos. The egg is eventually too much for them as it pulls them onto the floor before also becoming invisible. A horse covered in LEDs then runs in around the hallways. The \"wild\" horse scene is a metaphor for the idea of love, not being completely clear, while the egg scene adds to the metaphor by enhancing the people in the relationship with the cowboys, ropes and horse. Also, the floating egg being captured, tensioning its delicacy, is a metaphor for the female reproduction's myth and the weakness of male human violence. The video closes with Lipa dressed as a rodeo clown, slow dancing with an anonymous person, with both of them wearing all white. Lipa wears a red nose and wipes some of her lipstick of the same colour onto her partners jacket.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nMaia Kedem of Audacy hypothesized that Lipa wearing the clown makeup at the end was a metaphor for \"the clownery of falling back in love after experiencing heartbreak\", while calling the metaphor \"deep\". Hot Press's Ciaran Brennan viewed Lipa's style in the video as \"cowboy chic\". In Refinery29, Eliza Huber said that although Western tropes in fashion have been popular for a while, Lipa makes the style \"feel surprisingly fresh\" in the video, while also comparing it to the video for Madonna's \"Don't Tell Me\" (2000). Wang compared the hotel ballroom setting to The Shining (1980) while theorizing that the video documents the cast's \"slow decent into insanity\", \"putting on clown makeup to also hoedown in the building\u2019s empty ballroom\". For Grazia, Marisa Petrarca called the video \"absolute gold\" with Lipa embracing a \"glamorous take on Western fashion\" containing \"epic\" ensembles.For Vulture, Devon Ivie it a \"surrealist country-inspired video\" that her \"falling in love with [Lipa] all over again\". The staff of Wonderland said their minds \"are totally blown\" with the video while calling the fashion \"gorgeous\" and the choreography \"TikTok worthy dance routine\". In The A.V. Club, Gabrielle Sanchez noted science fiction elements in the video with the invisible mechanical bull. Similarly, Erica Gonzales of Harper's Bazaar thought these elements were more \"surreal\" while also stating that the clown makeup was the best part of the video and thought that it poked fun at the \"clownery\" of falling in love knowing it could end badly. In a review from Billboard, Gil Kaufman said that Lipa gets her \"urban cowgal on\" in the visual and thought she took a \"sensual, slow-mo ride\" on the mechanical bull. In W, Brooke Marine complemented Lipa's performance on the mechanical bull.Cinquemani thought that the main takeaway from the video was \"keep falling for the wrong person and the yolk's on you\" while noting its use of special effects and praising its surreality. He went on to note that Lipa's \"disco-cowgirl getup and choreography\" was similar to that of \"Don't Tell Me\" and Halsey's \"You Should Be Sad\" (2020). The staff of Contactmusic.com said that Lipa looks like a \"super-sexy Jessie Cowgirl\" and praised her \"natural born\" bull-riding skills. They also said that the video give the song \"a whole new lease of life\". For Consequence, Wren Graves named the video a \"campy rodeo fantasy\" while commending how Lipa waves her lasso, similarly to Wonder Woman. Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! stated that with the video, Lipa proves that \"country and western dressup is a trend that will simply not die\". \"Love Again\" won Best Pop Video at the 2021 UK Music Video Awards.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nShe performed \"Love Again\" for the first time on 30 March 2020 in a virtual performance for Amazon Music UK. On 29 May 2020, she performed it in a charity livestream for the COVID-19 pandemic. Lipa performed the song during her NPR Tiny Desk Concert, released 4 December 2020. Lipa described the performance as a \"special\" rendition of the song, and the concert was filmed in London instead of Washington, D.C. where the concerts normally take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She was accompanied by four backup singers, a bassist, a guitarist, and a drum machine. On 19 February 2021, she performed the track during the 2021 Time 100 event along with her 2020 single \"Levitating\". Lipa performed the soft piano rendition of the song as a duet with Elton John at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party on 25 April 2021. She performed the song at the 41st BRIT Awards as part of her set list of a Future Nostalgia Medley on 11 May 2021. The singer performed it at the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Festival on 17 September 2021. Lipa performed the song at a gala for Unicef in Saint Barth\u00e9lemy on New Year's Eve of 2021. The song was included on the setlist of Lipa's 2022 Future Nostalgia Tour.\n\n\n== Track listings ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDua Lipa \u2013  vocals\nKoz \u2013  production, bass, drums, guitar, synthesizer\nStuart Price \u2013  additional production, bass guitar, keyboards\nClarence Coffee Jr. \u2013  backing vocals\nAlma Goodman \u2013  backing vocals\nVanessa Luciano \u2013  backing vocals\nChelcee Grimes \u2013  backing vocals\nDrew Jurecka \u2013  baritone violin, string arrangement, string engineering, viola, violin\nAsh Soan \u2013  Tom Toms drums\nMatt Snell \u2013  engineering\nLorna Blackwood \u2013  programming, vocal production\nCameron Gower Poole \u2013  vocal engineer\nMatty Green \u2013  mixing\nChris Gehringer \u2013  mastering\nWill Quinnell \u2013  assistant mastering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one songs of the 2020s (Czech Republic)\nList of German airplay number-one songs of 2021\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAudio on YouTube\nLyric video on YouTube\nDirector's Cut on YouTube\nLyrics of this song at Genius",

Lead single \"On the Ground\" was also a commercial success, topping the Billboard Global 200 and peaking in the top five domestically.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== 1997\u20132015: Early life and career beginnings ===\nRoseanne Park (Korean: \ubc15\ucc44\uc601; Park Chae-young) was born on 11 February 1997 in Auckland, New Zealand, to South Korean immigrant parents. She has an older sister. In 2004, at the age of seven, Ros\u00e9 and her family moved to Melbourne, Australia. She attended Kew East Primary School, graduating in 2009, and completed secondary education at Canterbury Girls' Secondary College in Melbourne, studying law. She began singing and learned to play guitar and piano as a child and performed in church choirs.In 2012, at age 15, Ros\u00e9 attended an audition in Sydney, Australia for South Korean record label YG Entertainment at her father's suggestion, ranking first among 700 participants. She enjoyed the label's music greatly, citing they had all the \"cool\" groups. Within two months, Ros\u00e9 dropped out of school, signed with the label as a trainee, and moved to Seoul, South Korea. She initially presumed her father's idea was a joke due to the distance and difficulty of becoming a singer overseas, stating:\n\nIn Australia, I didn't think that there was much of a chance for me to become a singer, especially to become a K-pop star... I was living so far from the country that it never really occurred to me as a possibility.\nThe same year, Ros\u00e9 was given an opportunity to feature on labelmate G-Dragon's song \"Without You\" from his extended play (EP) One of a Kind (2012). Her name was not publicised at the time of release, her credit revealed only following her announcement as a member of Blackpink. The song peaked at number ten on South Korea's Gaon Music Chart and at number 15 on the Billboard Korea K-pop Hot 100.\n\n\n=== 2016\u2013present: Debut with Blackpink and R ===\n\nRos\u00e9 trained at YG Entertainment for four years before she was revealed as the final member of the girl group Blackpink on 22 June 2016. The group debuted on 8 August 2016 with the single album Square One, which featured the singles \"Whistle\" and \"Boombayah\".Ros\u00e9 appeared on a variety of broadcast programs, such as King of Masked Singer. Her vocal performance on the show was met with warm reception by the audience, to which Ros\u00e9 commented that she \"didn't know if the audience would like [her] singing\" and that she felt \"happy and relieved\" at the positive result. She later appeared as a performer on the second season of Fantastic Duo. The show's production staff stated that her appearance was intended to \"reveal Ros\u00e9's vocal appeal, which is different from Blackpink\".On 1 June 2020, it was announced that Ros\u00e9 would debut as a solo artist following the release of Blackpink's first Korean language full-length album. On 30 December 2020, in an interview with South Korean media outlet Osen, her label revealed that filming for her debut music video would begin in mid-January 2021. On 26 January 2021, a promotional teaser of Ros\u00e9's solo debut was released, revealing that a preview of her solo debut would be revealed through Blackpink Livestream Concert: The Show on 31 January 2021.\n\nRos\u00e9's debut single album, titled R, was released on 12 March 2021. With 41.6 million views in 24 hours of the music video for the lead single \"On the Ground\", she broke the almost eight-year record held by former labelmate Psy's \"Gentleman\" for the most viewed music video by a Korean soloist in 24 hours. \"On the Ground\" peaked at number 70 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the highest-charting song by a Korean female soloist in the US. The song also debuted and peaked at number one on both the Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, the first song by a Korean solo artist to do so. R also set the record for the highest first-week sales by a Korean female soloist, with 448,089 copies sold. On 24 March, Ros\u00e9 received her first-ever music show win as a soloist with her single \"On the Ground\" on South Korean cable music program Show Champion and would go on to win five more. On 5 April, the music video for Ros\u00e9's song \"Gone\" was released.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Influences and voice ===\nIn a radio interview, Ros\u00e9 cited labelmate Taeyang of Big Bang as a role model in her musical career. She also named American singer Tori Kelly as an inspiration towards her musical style. Since her debut with Blackpink, Ros\u00e9's voice has received acknowledgement in the K-pop industry for its distinct vocal timbre. Following Ros\u00e9's performance on Fantastic Duo 2, South Korean singer Gummy, whom Ros\u00e9 cited as a musical role model, complimented Ros\u00e9's voice for being \"so unique\" and describing it as \"the [type of] voice young people love\".\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Fashion and endorsements ===\nIn 2018, Ros\u00e9 and fellow Blackpink member Jisoo were selected as endorsement models for the Korean cosmetics brand Kiss Me.

In August 2021, Ros\u00e9 became a model for Korean unisex casual brand 5252 BY OIOI and contemporary brand OIOICOLLECTION. In December 2021, she announced her collaboration with the mediation and sleep app Calm, featuring her own bedtime story titled \"Grounded With Ros\u00e9\". In February 2022, alongside actor Yeo Jin-goo, Ros\u00e9 was selected as one of the models for Korean retail store Homeplus for the brand's 25th anniversary promotions.In July 2020, Ros\u00e9 was named the global ambassador for Yves Saint Laurent by creative director Anthony Vaccarello, its first global ambassador in 59 years. She was the global face of Saint Laurent's Fall 2020 campaign. In January 2021, Ros\u00e9 became the muse for luxury cosmetics brand Yves Saint Laurent Beaut\u00e9. In September 2021, Ros\u00e9 attended the Met Gala, a fundraising event held annually at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute in New York City, as Vaccarello's guest. Her and rapper CL's attendance made them the first female K-pop idols to attend the event.In April 2021, Ros\u00e9 was revealed as Tiffany & Co's newest global ambassador, beginning with its 2021 Tiffany HardWear digital campaign. She stated, \"I\u2019ve always loved wearing Tiffany jewellery. To be part of an iconic brand that has been part of my life for a long time makes it that much more special to me. I am very honoured and excited to be a part of the HardWear campaign and I can't wait for everyone to see it\".\n\n\n== Impact and influence ==\nAs of April 2021, Ros\u00e9 is among the top 10 most-followed Korean individuals on Instagram, with over 37 million followers. Since 2018, she has appeared on the Korean Business Research Institute's female celebrity brand reputation list, a chart that tracks Korean celebrities with the most online searches and engagements, and previously reached the top 10.

            "\"Shivers\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, released through Asylum Records and Atlantic Records on 10 September 2021 as the second single from his fifth studio album, = (2021). \"Shivers\" entered atop the charts in the United Kingdom and Ireland, dethroning Sheeran's previous single \"Bad Habits\" after eleven consecutive weeks at the summit in both countries. The song also topped the charts in Austria, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland and peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSheeran referred to the song while explaining why the album title was = instead of \u2013, as fans had predicted, in which he said: \"I was making the record and I wrote a song called 'Shivers' and I was like, 'This doesn't really feel like [Minus]\". Sheeran wrote \"Shivers\" at the end of the Divide tour, when he set up a studio at a rented farm in Suffolk where he had his last date of the tour. It took him three days to write the song, which was unusually long for him, as he felt the song \"was too special to get wrong\".\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nOn 19 August 2021, Sheeran announced his fourth studio album, =, in which the song is listed on the tracklist. He later announced the cover art and release date of the song on 2 September 2021. He also revealed that \"Shivers\" was originally intended to be the lead single for the album instead of its current lead single, \"Bad Habits\". A preview of the song was also listed. Sheeran announced its accompanying music video and a teaser video of it on Labour Day, 6 September 2021.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nOn 2 September 2021, the same day Sheeran announced the song, Jonathan Heaf from the United Kingdom branch of GQ in Sheeran's hometown, described the song as \"a sexy, rocketing song that includes hand claps in the bridge and is music to dance to with your best friends after three too many tequilas\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nA music video was released along with the song on 10 September 2021, starring Sheeran and AnnaSophia Robb. Just like his previous video \"Bad Habits\", it was directed by Dave Meyers. Sheeran emulates fellow English singer Elton John in scenes where he wears sequins and feathers.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Spotify and Tidal.\nEd Sheeran \u2013 vocals, songwriting, production, guitar, pizzicato violin\nJohnny McDaid \u2013 songwriting, unknown vocals, guitar\nKal Lavelle \u2013 songwriting\nSteve Mac \u2013 songwriting, production, keyboard, vocal production\nFred \u2013 production, bass, drums, guitar, keyboard, programming\nCharlie Holmes \u2013 assistant mixing\nChris Laws \u2013 drums, programming, unknown vocals, recording\nDan Pursey \u2013 vocal production, unknown vocals, recording\nGraham Archer \u2013 unknown vocals, vocal production\nJoe Rubel \u2013 unknown vocals, recording, additional programming\nKieran Beardmore \u2013 assistant mixing\nMark \u201cSpike\u201d Stent \u2013 mixing\nMatt Wolach \u2013 assistant mixing\nStuart Hawkes \u2013 mastering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShivers on YouTube",

            "\"You Right\" is a song by American rapper and singer Doja Cat and Canadian singer-songwriter the Weeknd, from the former's third studio album, Planet Her. It was released through Kemosabe and RCA Records on June 24, 2021, as the second single of the album. The song officially impacted American contemporary hit radio and rhythmic contemporary radio on June 29. The track received acclaim from music critics. Commercially, the song reached the top 15 in eleven countries and reached number 12 on the Billboard Global 200 chart.\n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nDoja Cat had expressed her desire for the Weeknd to feature on her third studio album, Planet Her, during the recording process, initially having showed him one song that she herself thought was \"the perfect song.\" According to Doja Cat, that song \"ended up not working,\" however after playing him the original solo version of \"You Right,\" which was already complete with two verses, he became \"obsessed\" with it and they replaced one of those solo verses with his own. An extended version of the song featuring Doja Cat's original second verse appeared as the fifteenth track on the deluxe edition of Planet Her, which was released on June 26.\n\"...he was obsessed with it and that's kind of all I wanted was a very good reaction [...] It's a beautiful, beautiful song.\"\nThe song's existence and its status as the \"steamy second single\" was announced on April 22, 2021, in a Billboard cover story interview with Doja Cat, in which the Weeknd had contributed the statement: \"Doja is a star, and has created a unique universe you just want to lose yourself in. She's got such drive and vast creative vision that we will be seeing her impact for a very long time to come.\" During a red carpet interview at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards in late May, Doja Cat once again confirmed that \"You Right\" would be the second single from Planet Her following \"Kiss Me More.\" The song marks the second collaboration between Doja Cat and the Weeknd, following the remix of the Weeknd's 2020 single \"In Your Eyes.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nVulture, during its review of Planet Her, described \"You Right\" as a song that serves to channel the feelings of self-pity. Fred Thomas of AllMusic found the song to be \"slick cosmic.\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Leah Greenblatt called \"You Right\" a \"slow-rolling infidelity anthem,\" featuring the \"dark-lord 3 a.m. energy\" of the Weeknd. In an NME article, Nick Levine called the song a \"dreamy duet\" between Doja Cat and the Weeknd, but noted the presence of Dr. Luke as a producer, who \"became a music industry pariah in 2014 after being accused of emotional abuse and sexual assault by Kesha,\" calling it \"telling\" that he was now credited as \"Dr. Luke\" instead of the pseudonym \"Tyson Trax\" used on \"Say So.\" Safy-Hallan Farah of Pitchfork wrote that the \"longing and yearning\" of Doja Cat's pre-chorus \"segues effortlessly into a resigned hook.\"\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video was filmed in June 2021, directed by Quentin Deronzier. The music video for \"You Right\" was released alongside the album on June 25, 2021. Doja Cat appeared on an episode of YouTube Originals' Released series leading up to the release. In the music video, Doja Cat is in a Greek goddess-like kingdom amongst the clouds. She sings about her temptations to cheat on her boyfriend (played by model Chris Petersen) with the Weeknd, who tries to convince Doja Cat into having the affair.The music video is heavily influenced by astrology, with Doja Cat and the Weeknd paying homage to their respective astrological signs. Doja Cat is a Libra, which is represented by the scales. In the beginning of the video, Doja Cat appears with her wig shaped as the zodiac's symbol, as she sings in the middle of a large balance scale. The Weeknd is an Aquarius, which is represented by the water bearer. When he appears in the video, he pours water from the zodiac's cup onto Doja Cat.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYou Right (Extended (Audio)) on YouTube\nYou Right (Behind The Scenes) on YouTube",

            "\"Levitating\" is a song by English singer Dua Lipa from her second studio album, Future Nostalgia (2020). The song was written by Lipa, Clarence Coffee Jr., Sarah Hudson, and Koz, who produced the song with Stuart Price, and stemmed from a Roland VP-330 synthesizer sample played by Koz. The song is an electro-disco and nu-disco song with several disco tropes. It incorporates elements of dance-pop, pop-funk, power pop and space rock, as well as 1970s, 1980s and 1990s pop and R&B styles. The lyrics describe the idea of \"levitating\" when falling in love, with several outer space references.\nA remix of \"Levitating\" by American DJ the Blessed Madonna featuring Madonna and Missy Elliott was released for digital download and streaming on 13 August 2020 as the lead single from Lipa and the Blessed Madonna's remix album Club Future Nostalgia (2020). It was categorised as an EDM, electro-disco, electro house, future bass, and techno track, with a throwback disco and trance vibe, and an increased tempo from the original. A second remix featuring American rapper DaBaby was released for the same formats on 1 October 2020 in promotion of the bonus edition of Future Nostalgia, as the album's fifth single. The remix impacted contemporary hit radio formats in the United States on 6 October 2020, serving as the album's third single in the country. The remix has the same production used in the original, with DaBaby adding a pop rap verse and intro.\n\"Levitating\" reached number five on the UK Singles Chart and number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lipa's seventh top-five single in the UK and second in the US. Despite not reaching number one in the United States, \"Levitating\" was named the number-one song of 2021, becoming the fourth single to accomplish this feat and the first single to do so since Lifehouse's \"Hanging by a Moment\" in 2001. It also ranks in the top 40 of its All-Time list. This song is also the longest-charting song by a female artist on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, spending 73 weeks on the chart. It also reached number two on the Billboard Global 200 chart, and became #1 on the 2021 year-end chart. The song was awarded a Platinum certification in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\n\"Levitating\" was promoted with the release of two music videos, one for each of its respective remixes. The Will Hooper-directed music video for the Blessed Madonna's remix was filmed in London and Atlanta and has a theme of \"love conquers all\". It sees many people under the influence of a mysterious planet, and being obsessed with a maze-like symbol. The DaBaby remix received a music video that was directed by Warren Fu and created in partnership with social media platform TikTok. The video is centred around Lipa and DaBaby dancing in an art deco-styled elevator, with many TikTok users in the cast. Lipa promoted the single with live performances on The Graham Norton Show, at the American Music Awards of 2020, and on Saturday Night Live.\n\n",

The video is centred around Lipa and DaBaby dancing in an art deco-styled elevator, with many TikTok users in the cast. Lipa promoted the single with live performances on The Graham Norton Show, at the American Music Awards of 2020, and on Saturday Night Live.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAfter figuring out the title of her second studio album, Future Nostalgia, Dua Lipa began working backwards, figuring out the sound she desired. Shortly after, \"Levitating\" was written, which is the first track recorded that appears on the album's final track listing. The song was written by Lipa with her longtime collaborators Clarence Coffee Jr. of The Monsters & Strangerz, Sarah Hudson and Stephen Kozmeniuk, the latter of which also handled the production. Before going into the studio, Kozmeniuk spent a few weeks coming up with ideas to play in the studio, eventually thinking it would be cool to create a \"slinky disco track.\" Lipa sent him some notes and stuff that she was inspired by, which became the idea of blending old with new. Kozmeniuk thought the best way to create this idea was to use old instruments, one of which was a Roland VP-330 synthesizer, which he had been looking for, for seven to eight years. After shipping the synthesizer from Tokyo to Toronto, he immediately plugged it in and began playing. The first thing he played, which he described as a \"synthetic choir sound\", later turned into the synth line from the song. He looped the sound and began building a song around it, including creating an analog string sound, also using the Roland VP-330.\"Levitating\" was written and recorded in a one-day studio session at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London between the four writers on 28 August 2018. They started the session by Hudson doing a Tarot card reading in order for the writers to open up about what was happening in their lives. Lipa recalled it \"changing the energy in the room.\" Kozmeniuk then began playing some tracks he had created with Lipa in mind. \"Levitating\" was one of the first tracks he played, which the collaborators all agreed that it would be the one to write onto. Lipa took out the voice memos app on her phone, and began leading the song by singing a melody, making it up on the way with Coffee later elevating it. They had the visuals of being in an Austin Powers movie, with Mike Myers doing a random dance to the song, which helped give them a mood while writing the lyrics. The session ended up with the collaborators ordering doughnuts and 'levitating' from the sugar rush. They immediately began writing after that, with a good feeling going into it. They decided to include the \"sugarboo\" lyric as an ode to their friendship as it was something they called one another as a joke. Lipa also decided to add a rap in order to get her British side across, because she often gets mistaken from where she is actually from.Lipa began by recording the lead vocals, and later some backing vocals and vocals with all the collaborators. They would create different personas with different vocals every time they recorded them. Lipa recalled that she and her co-writers were dancing all through making the song, even if they were experiencing writer's block or working on the production. After finishing the song, Lipa enlisted the help of Stuart Price for some additional production. He brought more \"bounce\" to the song and helped with the bass groove. He also incorporated a high drone synth as a disco trope, and a string part in the pre-chorus. Koz later also enlisted the help of Bosko Electrospit Kante to play a talk box. \"Levitating\" helped dictate what the rest of Future Nostalgia would sound like and where Lipa thought everything made sense, where she had both the \"future\" and \"nostalgia\" elements. She called it the \"starting point\" of the album.\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n\"Levitating\" is an electro-disco, nu-disco and pop-funk song, with dance-pop, power pop and space rock elements. The song incorporates music styles from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s pop and R&B. Constructed in verse\u2013chorus form, the song runs for 3 minutes and 23 seconds and is composed in 44 time and the key of B minor, with a tempo of 103 beats per minute and a chord progression of Bm7\u2014F\u266fm7\u2014Em7. It is built around a wonky synth hook, with 1990s choruses and several campy disco tropes. The rest of the production consists of funky synth disco beats, a \"squelchy\" bass, \"rubbery\" basslines, syncopated handclaps, nu-disco rhythms, \"wonky\" and \"bizarre\" synths, an EDM groove, funky guitars, talk box vocals, a \"hypnotic\" synth line and disco strings. The bass, guitars, and talk box give off a disco-funk feeling. Following the first chorus, the instruments are stripped back. On his remix, DaBaby adds a new pop rap verse and intro, over the original's production, with him serving as an additional writer on the track.Lipa's vocals range from F\u266f3 to B4. The middle eight includes a Blondie-influenced rap, where Lipa exerts her British accent, before she performs an a cappella ahead of the final chorus. \"Levitating\" has many outer space references, using an exaggerated metaphor of love as a spaceship to transmit radiant euphoria and happiness. Lyrically, the song sees Lipa exposing her feelings for a significant other and singing about moments with them in which she is her best self. For NME, Rhian Daly stated she sings about \"a love 'written in the stars'\", while 411Mania's David Hayter, labelled it an \"intergalactic ode to orgasms\". The song received many comparisons to the works of Chic, Daft Punk, Debbie Harry, the Jackson 5 (\"Blame It on the Boogie\", 1978), Kylie Minogue, Moloko, Kate Nash, Outkast (\"Rosa Parks\", 1998), Katy Perry, the Spice Girls, Tinie Tempah (\"Pass Out\", 2010), the Weeknd (Starboy, 2016), and Super Mario 64 (1996) sound effects.\nIt had to be fun and bubbly but with lyrics that felt really smart. This is about me exploring happy songs and doing something that's not 'dance crying'. It's about having fun and meeting someone and falling in love and thinking, 'You've probably met me at the perfect time, let's just go for it.' It's the feeling when love makes you feel like you're levitating. It's otherworldly. Things get quite Daft Punk-y here, but it's playful.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\n\"Levitating\" was released on 27 March 2020 as the fifth track on Lipa's second studio album, Future Nostalgia. In August 2020, Lipa confirmed that the song would serve as the album's fifth official single.

The challenge garnered 300,000,000 views and 150,000 video submissions, of which 16 creators were invited to be a part of the video. Three creators, Andrew Wilson, Ramana Borba and Rikki Sandhu, helped as part of the crew. They animated Lipa's cosmic dance floor, helped with some of the dance routines and designed the cosmic make up on Lipa's dancers, respectively. For the video, Lipa had a mood board consisting of Austin Powers, 1960s futurism and surrealism, Studio 54 and disco, thinking that \"Levitating\" was the perfect song to encapsulate these ideas.The music video was directed by American director Warren Fu, and took over 16 and a half hours to shoot, with stylist Lorenzo Posocco being on Zoom for over 17 hours during it. While filming, Lipa quickly decided that she did not like her look moments before going on camera, and within five minutes hairstylist Chris Appleton flipped her wig and gave her a whole new look. TikTok users Dexter Mayfield and Olivia Wong prepared for being on camera by vibing off everyone's energy and staying calm, respectively. DaBaby was originally supposed to be dressed as an astronaut for his shots, but ultimately did not due to the video's \"flow\", so he could just party. The visual premiered on YouTube at 13:00 BST (12:00 UTC) on 2 October 2020. It was proceeded by the release of two teasers on TikTok, in which Lipa invites users to \"The Levitating Experience\" that takes one to an \"intergalatic dance floor;\" she also warns viewers not to mess with the system and informs them about how to get there, among other items.An alternate animated music video was released on September 13, 2021, using the original version of the song without DaBaby. The music video was produced by Japanese animation group NOSTALOOK, in retro 1980s-1990s Japanese anime style, similar to Sailor Moon and Creamy Mami.\n\n\n=== Synopsis ===\n\nThe music video opens with Lipa lying on the hood of a classic car, watching the stars in the night sky. She sports blonde hair and glittering eye makeup, and wears a Misbhv sheer top, cargo trousers and Puma trainers as well as a \"sugarboo\" necklace which Hudson and Coffee gave her for her birthday. A portal of white light then appears out of nowhere, and Lipa's clothes change into a custom Atelier Versace mini dress made out of Swarovski crystal mesh; she worked closely with the Versace to create a \"disco dream\" dress. Lipa's \"sugarboo\" necklace then levitates off her neck, and she goes up materializing stairs into the portal. The portal transports her to a futuristic, art deco, disco and The Great Gatsby-themed elevator, which has gold trimming and the TikTok logo as its arrow indicating what floor they are on. She dances in the elevator, accompanied by two girls dressed as bellhops.Shortly after, the elevator reads \"Approaching KRK-91\", a reference to DaBaby's real name, Kirk, and his birth year, 1991. One of the bellhop girls then goes to the door, and swipes up on a screen next to it to a outline of DaBaby; she presses a button under it. The door opens and DaBaby enters the elevator, wearing a knitted multicolour monogram flower crewneck outfit from Louis Vuitton's FW20 collection, alongside silver jewels and a necklace that says \"Kirk\". DaBaby raps to the camera as Lipa casually dances behind him, where she blows a kiss and puts her arm around DaBaby. The elevator then reaches \"Roller World\", where girls on roller skates enter the elevator, with 1970s-inspired attire. They all dance together with large moves, and the elevator shines cherry red lights ever so often. The elevator reaches its final stop, and one of the bellhop girls swipes the screen to release. One of the passengers is launched into space, before the dancers begin to appear dancing on a Milky Way-like illuminated circular belt. Lipa is seen dancing on a platform in the middle of the belt, sporting bangs and wearing a Mugler dress with elbow-length gloves from Casey Cadwallader's autumn/winter 2020 show.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nThe staff of DIY labelled the \"Levitating\" music video \"glitzy and glam\", and noted its Studio 54 aesthetic. For the Gay Times, Sam Damshenas praised Lipa's \"intergalactic disco diva\" role. Katrina Rees of CelebMix named the video \"futuristic,\" while Idolator's Mike Wass pointed out its blockbuster production. In Vogue, Susan Devaney compared Lipa's custom Versace dress to that of previous outfits worn by Paris Hilton and Kendall Jenner. The magazine later placed the video among the \"Most-Stylish Music Videos of 2020\" list. Writing for Billboard, Heran Mamo called the video \"luxe,\" while Hypebeast's Clara Malley viewed it as \"a 'Great Gatsby'-meets-disco twist.\" In Rolling Stone, Claire Shaffer noted the visual's Milky Way themes and imagery.On April 5, 2022, the music video has garnered 500 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== DaBaby controversy ===\nOn 25 July 2021, DaBaby performed at Rolling Loud, in which he made controversial comments, saying, \"If you didn't show up today with HIV, AIDS, or any of them deadly sexually transmitted diseases that'll make you die in two to three weeks, then put your cellphone lighter up.\" His remarks drew condemnation, and Kirk responded to the allegations with \"What me and my fans do at the live show, it don't concern you niggas on the internet, or you bitter bitches on the internet.\" This caused Lipa's fans to ask that DaBaby be removed from the remix of \"Levitating\". On 27 July 2021, Lipa took to her Instagram story to denounce the remarks.The controversy later prompted the removal of the \"Levitating\" remix across multiple radio stations and Apple Music playlists in various countries. It was simultaneously replaced with the original solo version of the song, which was initially released in March 2020 as part of the album. Billboard later reported that while US radio audience impressions for all versions of the song combined was only down 1% for the tracking week of 23 to 29 July 2021, the percentage of the song's radio plays being the DaBaby remix declined following his remarks (dropping from 71% of all radio plays on 25 July to 59% on 29 July (the last day of the tracking week)). On the week ending 28 August 2021, DaBaby's credit was removed on the Billboard Hot 100 as the chart's rules state that the version of the song that contributes the greatest share of a song's performance on the chart is the one that is credited on the chart, indicating that the original solo version of the song had overtaken the DaBaby remix to have the greatest share of the song's overall performance that week.\n\n\n=== Copyright lawsuits ===\nOn 1 March 2022, reggae band Artikal Sound System filed a suit against Lipa and her label Warner Records alleging copyright infringement, asserting similarities between \"Levitating\" and their 2017 song \"Live Your Life\" (also alleging the producers have known the song before Levitating was in production). Less than a week later, a second suit by songwriters L. Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer claimed that \"Levitating\" infringed on their 1979 disco song \"Wiggle and Giggle All Night\".\n\n\n== The Blessed Madonna remix ==\n\n\n=== Background and release ===\nFollowing the release of Future Nostalgia, Lipa enlisted the help of the Blessed Madonna to create a remix album that would later become Club Future Nostalgia. The Blessed Madonna remixed two tracks on the record, \"Levitating\" and the previously-unreleased \"Love Is Religion\". For \"Levitating\", which had multiple versions, both Lipa and the Blessed Madonna had the vision of a \"fun\" club remix. The Blessed Madonna originally created it as if Lipa was the only person singing on it. After finishing the remix, Lipa thought that Madonna and Missy Elliott would sound amazing on it, so she reached out to both of them via email, with both responding saying they would be up for it. Madonna recorded her vocals in a separate studio, with her engineer Mike Dean sending them to the Blessed Madonna. Madonna did several variations, including breaking out into her 1983 single \"Lucky Star\" for a second. Elliott then sent her verse, which included an air horn. The Blessed Madonna then \"frankensteined\" the three parts together, before Madonna requested that Dean mix down the song. Dean ended up handing both the mastering and mix down. Both Madonna and Elliott are added as songwriters, while the Blessed Madonna is credited as the remixer and an additional producer.On 30 June 2020, Lipa's manager Ben Mawson revealed in an interview with Music Week that Lipa's team was attempting to organise a collaboration between her and Madonna. Future Nostalgia was heavily influenced by Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor, both of which feature songs co-produced by Stuart Price, including \"Levitating\". On 27 July 2020, Lipa announced the single release of a remix of \"Levitating\" by the Blessed Madonna featuring Madonna and Missy Elliott. The song was later confirmed to be the lead single of Club Future Nostalgia. The song premiered at 09:00 PT (16:00 UTC) on 13 August 2020, being released for digital download and streaming. The remix was serviced to contemporary hit radio formats in Italy the same day, and was also released on 12-inch vinyl on 21 August 2020 by We Still Believe, an independent label owned by the Blessed Madonna.\n\n\n=== Composition ===\nThe Blessed Madonna's remix of \"Levitating\" is an EDM, electro-disco, electro house, future bass and techno track. It runs for 4 minutes and 10 seconds, and has a throwback disco and trance vibe. It increases the tempo of the original, with Lipa, Madonna and Elliott each contributing a verse. Lipa and Madonna harmonise with one and other, while trading verses and Elliott half-sings and half-raps. The remix has a dance-orientated house production, consisting of Daft Punk vocoder backing vocals, a pounding bass, nostalgic and futuristic synths, and house beats.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\n\nThe Blessed Madonna's remix of \"Levitating\" was met with mixed reviews from music critics. In Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos viewed the Blessed Madonna \"Levitating\" remix as \"tongue-twistingly,\" a \"fast-paced romp,\" and \"clubbier\" than the original, while also labelling Elliott's verse \"flirty\" and \"freaky.\" The staff of Rap-Up called it a \"pulsing dance-floor bop,\" while Maia Kedem of Radio.com viewed Elliott's verse as \"tastefully naughty.\" Billboard's Katie Bain noted the remix for being \"darkly funky\" and stated it brings the original to \"new heights\" while Heran Mamo of the same magazine stated it shows Lipa's \"star power.\" Nick Romano of Entertainment Weekly said the remix is \"what you need to turn any isolated apartment into the hottest club.\"For Slant Magazine, Alexa Camp praised Elliott's \"versatility,\" and stated the Blessed Madonna's \"Levitating\" remix is worthy of Giorgio Moroder or Cerrone, while Madonna's vocal delivery to Jody Watley. Joe Price of Complex praised Elliott and Madonna's vocals complimenting Lipa's, and noted its further cementation of Lipa's crossover appeal. In a negative review from Clash, Robin Murray stated it has a \"truncated nature\" feeling that does not \"click into place,\" while also commenting that it \"doesn't get the space to breathe properly.\" AllMusic's Neil Z. Yeung agreed, writing it fails to hit \"the highs that the crew targeted.\" For The Line of Best Fit, Udit Mahalingam thought that it failed to live up to the original. Pitchfork's Owen Myers viewed the Elliott and Madonna features as deflating the remix. In The Guardian, Michael Cragg rated the remix a 6 out of 10, and stated it is \"another example of 2020's endless disappointments.\"In Canada, the Blessed Madonna's remix reached number 16 on the Canadian Digital Song Sales, In the United States, the Blessed Madonna's remix debuted and peaked at number 10 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart, while also reaching number 6 on the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart, lasting one and seven weeks on each chart respectively.

Following the release of the DaBaby remix, the Blessed Madonna's remix debuted at number 35 on Australia's ARIA Singles Chart dated 19 October 2020.\n\n\n=== Music video ===\n\n\n==== Background and reception ====\n\nThe music video for the Blessed Madonna's remix of \"Levitating\" was directed by Will Hooper and produced by production company Blink, led by producer Corin Taylor and executive producer Laura Northover. Due to lockdown restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the video concept was developed virtually, with many video calls with Lipa and her management team TAP. The crew ran into difficulties during the production due to several film industry services being closed or running at a reduced service. They made sure to run a safe set and follow the government's guidance toward the virus. The video includes appearances from Lipa, Elliott, and Lipa's then-boyfriend, Anwar Hadid, with both the Blessed Madonna and Madonna being absent. It draws inspiration from extraterrestrial life and science fiction. Rina Yang serves as the video's director of photography, and she creates a contemporary and inspired vision, somewhere in between fashion editorial and home video, with many blue and red hues.The music video was filmed in June 2020 in London over the course of 4 days, while Elliott filmed her parts with her respective team in Atlanta, in conjunction with Lipa's UK team. It was one of the first large productions to shoot to APA guidelines after the lockdown restrictions. Due to social distancing protocols associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the production team decided to cast real couples, which led to Hadid's casting. The video's filming, which song was then unknown, was reported on 18 June 2020, along with Hadid's casting. The visual premiered at 05:00 PT (12:00 UTC) on 14 August 2020. Rania Aniftos of Billboard labelled the Blessed Madonna's \"Levitating\" remix video \"colourful\" and \"dreamy.\" For Consequence of Sound, Lake Schatz noted its \"candy-coated, Miami glaze\" lenses and praised its \"mythical and celestial imagery.\" He concluded by stating the video is \"snazzy\" and like \"a four-minute Ring Pop.\" Radio.com's Maia Kedem viewed the video as a mix of Sailor Moon, Euphoria, and Twilight. In her review for Vogue, Janelle Okwodu complimented its \"trippy visuals, bright colors\" and wardrobe that visualise Future Nostalgia's \"retro rave theme.\"\n\n\n==== Synopsis ====\nThe music video has a theme of \"love conquers all,\" and consists of many scenes synthesising to depict many romance moments, with each scene being woven in and out of the storyline. The storyline features numerous people getting obsessed with a maze-like symbol while under the influence of a mysterious glowing planet. Throughout the video, psychedelic shots of ghostly fields and gem-studded cars are shown. The video begins with a montage of some of the video's events, before Lipa is seen looking at the planet out of a window from an apartment. Her hair is dyed hot pink and she wears Martine Rose logo print PJ pants and an e-girl python bodysuit. She begins to dance around the apartment where a vinyl is playing, and is filled analog recorders and buzzing televisions.\n\nThe next scene sees a blonde woman in a bedroom looking at herself in a mirror and holding a small item with the maze-like symbol that she hides under her pillow, but later breaks it in half. She then looks through a telescope at a brunette girl reading a book. The brunette girl looks straight at the telescope, slightly scaring the blonde girl, before the brunette eats the same item that the blonde girl put under her pillow. In the following scene, a bunch of people hang out in a skating park, drawing the maze-like symbol with chalk and skating, as well as a couple kissing. Next, two people are scene walking under a highway-like structure, which has graffiti of the maze-like symbol, with one holding a briefcase. They eventually get to a spot where they open a green-like crystal. Following, a man is seen in the middle of a field, spray-painting the symbol on a white sheet. Another man is seen driving his car to a point near the highway-like structure. He pulls a net out of a his car and looks up into the sky. This scene ends with a moon appearing in his car, before a woman takes its place.Towards the end, Elliott makes her appearance for her verse. She wears Versace palm print, with a lime green jacket and baseball cap alongside outsized hoop earrings and lengthy box braids. A woman in a shimmery disco ball dress is seen dancing in a field, appearing there from a shooting star. Lipa and Hadid are then seen lying in a field of flowers and driving a car into the planet, in which the two kiss. Lipa wears a white-striped navy sailor-inspired Miu Miu knit bodysuit with a Peter Pan collar, while Hadid sports a low key t-shirt and jeans. The visual ends with Lipa and Hadid starring off at the planet.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\"Levitating\" appeared on the 2020 year-end lists by numerous publications, including being placed as the best song of the year by Cosmopolitan and the Herald Sun.

            "\"Your Power\" is a song by American singer Billie Eilish. The song was released by Darkroom and Interscope Records on April 29, 2021, as the third single off of Eilish's second studio album, Happier Than Ever (2021). The song was written by Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell, with production being handled by the latter.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nEilish released a snippet of \"Your Power\", a ballad with acoustic instrumentation, on April 28, 2021. Regarding the track, Eilish stated, \"This is one of my favorite songs I've ever written. I feel very vulnerable putting this one out because I hold it so close to my heart. This is about many different situations that we've all either witnessed or experienced. I hope I can inspire change. Try not to abuse your power.\" In her 2021 British Vogue cover story following the release of her single, the 19-year-old star talks her new song's \"open letter to people who take advantage,\" body image, and sexual misconduct. In an official Vevo Happier Than Ever interview, Eilish said that she chooses singles because of their lyrics rather than if the song \"will be big\". Regarding \"Your Power\", the singer expressed that the song felt like \"very kind of middle ground for the album\". According to her, she assigns \"tang brown\" color to both the song, and the album.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nCritics, who described the song as a folk ballad, noted the timbral contrast between the track and Eilish's older work. In an article, The Guardian's Alexis Petridis wrote that the song \"dials down the electronic horror-movie soundtrack approach of Eilish's previous album in favour of something more understated ... there's nothing to it but an acoustic guitar and Eilish's reverb-drenched voice\"; thereafter, Petridis noted stylistic influences from Mazzy Star and Lana Del Rey. Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos shared similar opinions, writing that \"Eilish sings above a delicate, acoustic guitar riff.\"\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\nIn the United States, \"Your Power\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 10 as the week's highest debut. The song marks Billie's third top 10 debut on the chart and fifth top 10 overall.  The following week, \"Your Power\" plummeted to number 29, before further falling to number 54 in its third.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Music video ==\nAn accompanying music video was released alongside the song. The video was directed by Eilish herself. It depicts Eilish singing the song on the mountainside. An 80-pound (36 kg) anaconda later appears and slowly wraps itself around Eilish.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "Catch-22 is a satirical war novel by American author Joseph Heller. He began writing it in 1953; the novel was first published in 1961. Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century, it uses a distinctive non-chronological third-person omniscient narration, describing events from the points of view of different characters. The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot.\nThe novel is set during World War II, from 1942 to 1944. It mainly follows the life of antihero Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th US Army Air Squadron is based on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean Sea west of Italy, though it also covers episodes from basic training at Lowry Field in Colorado and Air Corps training at Santa Ana Army Air Base in California. The novel examines the absurdity of war and military life through the experiences of Yossarian and his cohorts, who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home.\nThe book was made into a film adaptation in 1970, directed by Mike Nichols. In 1994, Heller published a sequel to the 1961 novel entitled Closing Time.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe development of the novel can be split into segments. The first (chapters 1\u201311) broadly follows the story fragmented between characters, but in a single chronological time in 1944. The second (chapters 12\u201320) flashes back to focus primarily on the \"Great Big Siege of Bologna\" before once again jumping to the chronological present of 1944 in the third part (chapter 21\u201325). The fourth (chapters 26\u201328) flashes back to the origins and growth of Milo's syndicate, with the fifth part (chapter 28\u201332) returning again to the narrative present and maintaining the tone of the previous four. The sixth and final part (chapter 32 and on) remains in the story's present, but takes a much darker turn and spends the remaining chapters focusing on the serious and brutal nature of war and life in general.\nPreviously the reader had been cushioned from experiencing the full horror of events, but in the final section, the events are laid bare. The horror begins with the attack on the undefended Italian mountain village, with the following chapters involving despair (Doc Daneeka and the chaplain), disappearance in combat (Orr and Clevinger), disappearance caused by the army (Dunbar) or death of most of Yossarian's friends (Nately, McWatt, Kid Sampson, Dobbs, Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe), culminating in the horrors of Chapter 39, in particular the rape and murder of the innocent young woman, Michaela. In Chapter 41 the full details of the death of Snowden are finally revealed.\nNevertheless, the novel ends on an upbeat note with Yossarian learning of Orr's miraculous escape to Sweden and Yossarian's pledge to follow him there.\n\n\n== Style ==\nMany events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about each event from each iteration, with the new information often completing a joke, the setup of which was told several chapters previously. The narrative's events are out of sequence, but events are referred to as if the reader is already familiar with them so that the reader must ultimately piece together a timeline of events. Specific words, phrases, and questions are also repeated frequently, generally to comic effect.Much of Heller's prose in Catch-22 is circular and repetitive, exemplifying in its form the structure of a Catch-22. Circular reasoning is widely used by some characters to justify their actions and opinions. Heller revels in paradox. For example: \"The Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him\"; and \"The case against Clevinger was open and shut. The only thing missing was something to charge him with.\" This atmosphere of apparently logical irrationality pervades the book. This style is also recognizable regarding how exactly Clevinger's trial would be executed by Lieutenant Scheisskopf: \"As a member of the Action Board, Lieutenant Scheisskopf was one of the judges who would weigh the merits of the case against Clevenger as presented by the prosecutor. Lieutenant Scheisskopf was also the prosecutor. Clevinger had an officer defending him. The officer defending him was Lieutenant Scheisskopf.\":\u200a76\u200aWhile a few characters are most prominent, especially Yossarian and the Chaplain, the majority of named characters are described in detail with fleshed out or multidimensional personas to the extent that there are few if any \"minor characters\". There are no traditional heroes in the novel, reflecting the underlying commentary that war has no heroes, only victims.Although its nonchronological structure may at first seem random, Catch-22 is highly structured. It is founded on a structure of free association; ideas run into one another through seemingly random connections. For example, Chapter 1, titled \"The Texan\", ends with \"everybody but the CID man, who had caught a cold from the fighter captain and come down with pneumonia.\":\u200a24\u200a Chapter 2, titled \"Clevinger\", begins with \"In a way, the CID man was pretty lucky because outside the hospital the war was still going on.\":\u200a25\u200a The CID man connects the two chapters like a free association bridge and eventually Chapter 2 flows from the CID man to Clevinger through more free association links.\n\n\n== Themes ==\n\n\n=== Paradox ===\nYossarian comes to fear his commanding officers more than he fears the Germans attempting to shoot him down and he feels that \"they\" are \"out to get him\". The reason Yossarian fears his commanders more than the enemy is that as he flies more missions, Colonel Cathcart increases the number of required combat missions before a soldier may return home; he reaches the magic number only to have it retroactively raised. He comes to despair of ever getting home and is greatly relieved when he is sent to the hospital for a condition that is almost jaundice. In Yossarian's words:\n\n The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on, and that includes Colonel Cathcart. And don't you forget that, because the longer you remember it, the longer you might live.:\u200a124\u200a\n\n\n=== Tragedy and farce ===\nMuch of the farce in the novel is fueled by intentional and unintentional miscommunication, occasionally leading to tragic consequences. For example, Cathcart's desire to become a general is thwarted by ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen sabotaging his correspondence. Major Major's and Yossarian's mis-censoring of correspondence is blamed on the Chaplain, who is threatened with imprisonment as a result.\n\n\n=== Theodicy ===\nYossarian questions the idea that God is all-powerful, all-good, and all knowing. The narrator seems to believe that God, if not evil, is incompetent. In chapter 18, Yossarian states that he \"believes in the God he doesn't believe in\", this version of God having created Hitler, the war, and all the failures of human life and society, as exemplified in the following passage:\"And don't tell me God works in mysterious ways\", Yossarian continued, hurtling over her objections. \"There's nothing so mysterious about it. He's not working at all. He's playing or else He's forgotten all about us. That's the kind of God you people talk about\u2014a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did he ever create pain? \u2026 Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain! [to warn us of danger] Why couldn't He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of His celestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person's forehead. Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn't He? \u2026 What a colossal, immortal blunderer! When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly little mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. \u2026\"Later Heller writes of Yossarian wandering through a war-torn Italian city (Chapter 39):  \"Yossarian quickened his pace to get away, almost ran. The night was filled with horrors, and he thought he knew how Christ must have felt as he walked through the world, like a psychiatrist through a ward full of nuts, like a victim through a prison full of thieves. What a welcome sight a leper must have been. At the next corner a man was beating a small boy brutally in the midst of an immobile crowd of adult spectators who made no effort to intervene ...\"\n\n\n=== Anti-capitalism ===\nWhile the military's enemies are Germans, none appear in the story as enemy combatants. This ironic situation is epitomized in the single appearance of German personnel in the novel, who act as pilots employed by the squadron's mess officer, Milo Minderbinder, to bomb the American encampment on Pianosa. This predicament indicates a tension between traditional motives for violence and the modern economic machine, which seems to generate violence simply as another means to profit, quite independent of geographical or ideological constraints which creates a military\u2013industrial complex. Heller emphasizes the danger of profit-seeking by portraying Milo without \"evil intent\". Milo's actions are portrayed as the result of greed, not malice.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n== Influences ==\nHeller wanted to be a writer from an early age. His experiences as a bombardier during World War II inspired Catch-22; Heller later said that he \"never had a bad officer\". In a 1977 essay on Catch-22, Heller stated that the \"antiwar and antigovernment feelings in the book\" were a product of the Korean War and the 1950s rather than World War II itself. Heller's criticisms are not intended for World War II but for the Cold War and McCarthyism.The influence of the 1950s on Catch-22 is evident through Heller's extensive use of anachronism. Though the novel is ostensibly set in World War II, Heller intentionally included anachronisms like loyalty oaths and computers (IBM machines) to situate the novel in the context of the 1950s.  Many of the characters are based on or connected to individuals from the 1950s:\n\nMilo Minderbinder's maxim \"What's good for M&M Enterprises is good for the country\" alludes to the former president of General Motors Charles Erwin Wilson's statement before the Senate: \"What's good for General Motors is good for the country.\"\nThe question of \"Who promoted Major Major?\" alludes to Joseph McCarthy's questioning of the promotion of Major Peress, an army dentist who refused to sign loyalty oaths.Czech writer Arno\u0161t Lustig recounts in his book 3x18 that Joseph Heller told him that he would never have written Catch-22 had he not first read The Good Soldier \u0160vejk by Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek.In 1998, some critics raised the possibility that Heller's book had questionable similarities to Louis Falstein's 1950 novel, Face of a Hero. Falstein never raised the issue between Catch-22's publication and his death in 1995 and Heller claimed never to have been aware of the obscure novel. Heller said that the novel had been influenced by C\u00e9line, Waugh and Nabokov. Many of the similarities have been stated to be attributable to the authors' experiences, both having served as U.S. Army Air Forces aircrew in Italy in World War II. However, their themes and styles are different.\n\n\n== Concept ==\nA \"Catch-22\" is \"a problem for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule.\" For example, losing something is typically a conventional problem; to solve it, one looks for the lost item until one finds it. But if the thing lost is one's glasses, one cannot see to look for them \u2013 a Catch-22. The term \"Catch-22\" is also used more broadly to mean a tricky problem or a no-win or absurd situation.\nIn the book, Catch-22 is a military rule typifying bureaucratic operation and reasoning. The rule is not stated in a precise form, but the principal example in the book fits the definition above: If one is crazy, one does not have to fly missions; and one must be crazy to fly. But one has to apply to be excused, and applying demonstrates that one is not crazy. As a result, one must continue flying, either not applying to be excused, or applying and being refused. The narrator explains:\n\nThere was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to, but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. (p. 56, ch. 5)\nOther forms of Catch-22 are invoked throughout the novel to justify various bureaucratic actions. At one point, victims of harassment by military police quote the MPs' explanation of one of Catch-22's provisions: \"Catch-22 states that agents enforcing Catch-22 need not prove that Catch-22 actually contains whatever provision the accused violator is accused of violating.\" Another character explains: \"Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.\"\nYossarian comes to realize that Catch-22 does not actually exist, but because the powers that be claim it does, and the world believes it does, it nevertheless has potent effects. Indeed, because it does not exist, there is no way it can be repealed, undone, overthrown, or denounced. The combination of force with specious and spurious legalistic justification is one of the book's primary motifs.\nThe motif of bureaucratic absurdity is further explored in 1994's Closing Time, Heller's sequel to Catch-22. This darker, slower-paced, apocalyptic novel explores the pre- and post-war lives of some of the major characters in Catch-22, with particular emphasis on the relationship between Yossarian and tail gunner Sammy Singer.\n\n\n== Literary allusions ==\nCatch-22 contains allusions to many works of literature. Howard Jacobson, in his 2004 introduction to the Vintage Classics publication, wrote that the novel was \"positioned teasingly ... between literature and literature's opposites \u2013 between Shakespeare and Rabelais and Dickens and Dostoevsky and Gogol and C\u00e9line and the Absurdists and of course Kafka on the one hand, and on the other vaudeville and slapstick and Bilko and Abbott and Costello and Tom and Jerry and the Goons (if Heller had ever heard of the Goons).\"\nOne critic argues that it is Kafka's influence that can be seen most strongly in the novel:  \"Like Kafka's heroes, Yossarian is riddled with anxiety and caught in an inexorable nightmare \u2013 in his case created by Colonel Cathcart and the inevitability of his raising the number of missions he has to fly.\"\n\n\n== Historical context ==\nThe idea for Catch-22 was based on Joseph Heller's personal experience in World War II. The feelings that Yossarian and the other bomber crew felt were taken directly from problems he suffered while on duty. Heller flew 60 bombing missions from May to October in 1944. Heller was able to make it out of the war, but it took until 1953 before he could start writing about it. For this reason, the book contains references to post World War II phenomena like IBM computers and loyalty oaths. The war experience turned Heller into a \"tortured, funny, deeply peculiar human being\".After publication in 1961, Catch-22 became very popular among teenagers at the time. Catch-22 seemed to embody the feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of Catch-22. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States. On October 26, 1986, professor and author John W. Aldridge wrote a piece in The New York Times celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publishing of Catch-22. He commented that Heller's book presaged the chaos in the world that was to come:\n\nThe comic fable that ends in horror has become more and more clearly a reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities of the world in which we live and hope to survive.\nAlthough Catch-22 is considered by many to be an anti-war novel, Heller stated in a talk he gave at the New York Public Library on August 31, 1998, that he and the other men he knew in World War II considered the war to be \"noble\" and \"nobody really objected to fighting it\". The anti-war reputation of the novel was fueled instead by the pacifist, anti-war ethos among young Americans surrounding the Vietnam War.\n\n\n== Title ==\nThe title refers to a fictional bureaucratic stipulation that embodies illogical and immoral reasoning. The opening chapter of the novel was first published, in 1955, by New World Writing as Catch-18, but Heller's agent, Candida Donadio, asked him to change the title, to avert its confusion with Leon Uris's recently published Mila 18. The implications in Judaism of the number 18 \u2014 which refers to chai, meaning \"alive\", in Gematria \u2014 were relevant to Heller's somewhat greater emphasis on Jewish themes in early drafts of his novel.Parallels among a number of character exchanges in the novel suggested the doubled-one title of Catch-11, but the 1960 release of Ocean's Eleven eliminated that. Catch-17 was rejected so as not to be confused with the World War II film Stalag 17, as was Catch-14, apparently because the publisher did not believe that 14 was a \"funny number\". Eventually, the title came to be Catch-22, which, like 11, has a duplicated digit, with the 2 also referring to a number of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu-like events common in the novel.\n\n\n== Publication and movie rights ==\nCatch-22 was sold to Simon & Schuster, where it had been championed by editor Robert Gottlieb, who, along with Nina Bourne, would edit and oversee the marketing of the book. Gottlieb was a strong advocate for the book along with Peter Schwed and Justin Kaplan. Henry Simon, a vice president at Simon & Schuster, found it repetitive and offensive. The editorial board decided to contract the book when Heller agreed to revisions; he signed for US$1,500 (equivalent to about $13,600 in 2021).Officially published on October 10, 1961, the hardcover sold for $5.95. The book was not a best-seller in hardcover in the United States. Though twelve thousand copies were sold by Thanksgiving, it never entered The New York Times Best Seller list. It received good notices and was nominated for the National Book Award in March 1962, though Walker Percy's The Moviegoer won. Catch-22 went through four printings in hardcover but sold well on only the East Coast. The book never established itself nationally until it was published in paperback for 75 cents.:\u200a224\u2013230\u200aUpon publication in Great Britain, the book became the No. 1 best-seller.:\u200a233\u200a  Don Fine of Dell Paperbacks bought the paperback reprint rights to Catch-22 for $32,000. Between the paperback's release in September 1962 and April 1963, it sold 1.1 million copies.:\u200a238\u2013240\u200aIn August 1962, Donadio brokered the sale of movie rights to Columbia Pictures for $100,000 plus $25,000 to write a treatment or a first draft of a screenplay.:\u200a234\u200a\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe initial reviews of the book ranged from very positive to very negative. There were positive reviews from The Nation (\"the best novel to come out in years\"), the New York Herald Tribune (\"A wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller-coaster of a book\") and The New York Times (\"A dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it delights\"). On the other hand, The New Yorker (\"doesn't even seem to be written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper\", \"what remains is a debris of sour jokes\") and a second review from the New York Times (\"repetitive and monotonous. Or one can say that it is too short because none of its many interesting characters and actions is given enough play to become a controlling interest\") disliked it. One commentator of Catch-22 recognized that \"many early audiences liked the book for just the same reasons that caused others to hate it\".:\u200a11\u200a The book had a cult following though, especially among teenagers and college students. Heller remarks that in 1962, after appearing on the Today show he went out drinking with the host at the time, John Chancellor, who handed him stickers that Chancellor had got privately printed reading \"YOSSARIAN LIVES\". Heller also said that Chancellor had been secretly putting them on the walls of the corridors and executive bathrooms in the NBC building.:\u200a11\u200aAlthough the novel won no awards upon release, it has remained in print and is seen as one of the most significant American novels of the 20th century. Scholar and fellow World War II veteran Hugh Nibley said it was the most accurate book he ever read about the military. As of 2019 ten million copies have been sold.Although he continued writing, including a sequel novel Closing Time, Heller's later works were inevitably overshadowed by the success of Catch-22. When asked by critics why he'd never managed to write another novel as good as his first, Heller would retort with a smile, \"Who has?\"\n\n\n=== Challenges ===\nCatch-22 has landed on the list of the American Library Association's banned and challenged classics.\nIn 1972, the school board in Strongsville, Ohio removed Catch-22, as well as two books by Kurt Vonnegut, from school libraries and the curriculum. Five families sued the school board. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the claim, stating that school boards had the right to control the curriculum. The decision was overturned on appeal in 1976. The court wrote, \"A library is a storehouse of knowledge. Here we are concerned with the right of students to receive information which they and their teachers desire them to have.\" In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court employed a similar rationale in its decision in Island Trees School District v. Pico on the removal of library books.Because the book refers to women as \"whores\", it was challenged at the Dallas, Texas, Independent School District (1974) and Snoqualmie, Washington (1979).\n\n\n== Rankings ==\nThe Modern Library ranked Catch-22 as the 7th (by review panel) and 12th (by public) greatest English-language novel of the 20th century.\nThe Radcliffe Publishing Course rank Catch-22 as number 15 of the 20th century's top 100 novels.\nThe Observer listed Catch-22 as one of the 100 greatest novels of all time.\nTime puts Catch-22 in the top 100 English-language modern novels (1923 onwards, unranked).\nThe Big Read by the BBC ranked Catch-22 as number 11 on a web poll of the UK's best-loved book.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\nCatch-22 was adapted into a feature film of the same name in 1970, directed by Mike Nichols. Alan Arkin portrayed Capt. Yossarian, with an ensemble cast including Art Garfunkel as Nately, Jon Voight as Milo Minderbinder, Orson Welles as General Dreedle, and Martin Balsam as Colonel Cathcart, amongst many others.\nA pilot for a comedy series based upon Catch-22 was made and televised in 1973, with Richard Dreyfuss in the starring role of Yossarian.\nCatch-22 play: Aquila Theatre produced a stage adaptation of Catch-22, based on Heller's 1971 stage adaption. It was directed by Peter Meineck.

            "\"Take My Breath\" is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter the Weeknd. It was released on August 6, 2021, through XO and Republic Records, as the lead single from his fifth studio album Dawn FM (2022). The song was written and produced by the Weeknd, Max Martin and Oscar Holter, with Belly, Andrea Di Ceglie and Luigi Tutolo receiving additional songwriting credits.A disco, dance-pop, funk and synthwave track with psychedelic elements, \"Take My Breath\" was met with widespread critical acclaim for the Weeknd's vocals and its production, which was influenced by the beats and synthesizers of the 1980s. The song debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, marking the Weeknd's thirteenth top 10 entry.\n\n\n== Background and promotion ==\nThe Weeknd first teased that he was working on a new album in September 2020, via an interview with Rolling Stone in which he stated \"I might have another album ready to go by the time this quarantine is over\". Later on during the 2021 Billboard Music Awards in May, he went on to state in his acceptance speech \"I just want to say the After Hours are done and The Dawn is coming.\" Throughout June and July, the Weeknd continued to mention his upcoming project under the tentative title The Dawn by revealing a new transitional look. He also released the singles \"You Right\" with Doja Cat and \"Better Believe\" with Belly and Young Thug during that period.On August 2, 2021, a snippet of \"Take My Breath\" with a visual of a sunrise titled \"The Dawn Is Coming\" and a GQ cover story was released in anticipation of new music. The title of the single and its release date of August 6 was confirmed later that day through a promotional video for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which featured hurdlers Sydney McLaughlin and Dalilah Muhammad, middle-distance runner Athing Mu and sprinter Gabrielle Thomas.\n\n\n== Lyrics and composition ==\n\"Take My Breath\" has been described by music critics as a disco, dance-pop, funk and synthwave track with elements of psychedelia. The single and radio version of the song runs for a duration of three minutes and forty seconds, while the extended version has a length of five minutes and fifty-one seconds. Also, the album version of the song runs for a duration of five minutes and thirty-nine seconds, which segues from the preceding track \"How Do I Make You Love Me?\". It was written in the key of C minor with a tempo of 121 beats per minute. Lyrically, the song details an entanglement in a romantic relationship that ultimately leads to autoerotic asphyxiation.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Take My Breath\" received widespread critical acclaim. The vocals and production of the track received praise from Billboard's Joe Lynch, who compared the latter aspect's usage of a synthesizer to the synth riff that was used in Donna Summer's 1977 single \"I Feel Love\". Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian gave the song a five-star rating, stating that it is \"an instant disco-pop masterpiece\". Consequence of Sound writer Mary Siroky complimented \"Take My Breath\", \u201cthe music is pulsing, almost dizzying in its dance-floor intensity from start to finish, leaving the listener appropriately breathless\u201d. Chief critic Jon Pareles of The New York Times highlighted the record\u2019s retro appeal, \u201cthe disco thump, electric piano chords and call-and-response falsetto vocals in \"Take My Breath\" hark back to vintage Bee Gees. Journalist Quinn Moreland from Pitchfork complimented the intro and chorus, \u201cfrom the strutting intro to the extremely infectious melody, \"Take My Breath\" is full of life\u201d. Many listeners have noted that the single is reminiscent of Michael Jackson in terms of vocals, and the late 1980s in terms of production.\n\n\n=== Year-end lists ===\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for \"Take My Breath\" was first teased by the Weeknd on social media via self-released images of the visual during the week leading up to the release of the single. Directed by Cliqua, it originally was supposed to play before IMAX showings of The Suicide Squad, but was reportedly pulled due to epilepsy concerns in regards to the pervasive strobe lighting in the video. The video was released alongside the song on August 6, 2021.The video starts with the Weeknd walking outside overlooking a sunrise, before entering a nightclub with pulsating strobe lights. Upon entering the club, he meets his love interest, played by actress and stuntwoman Shaina West. The two dance together and exchange breaths through an oxygen tank, before the Weeknd's breath is literally taken away as he gets strangled by West's braids. The video ends with the Weeknd regaining his breath and consciousness as he is seen lying down on the club floor with a snippet of \"Sacrifice\" playing in the background. As of early 2022, the video has over 100 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n== Use in media ==\n\"Take My Breath\" was used as the theme song for WWE's 2021 pay-per-view Crown Jewel.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nDigital single #1\n\"Take My Breath\" \u2013 3:40Digital single #2 / CD Maxi-single\n\"Take My Breath\" \u2013 3:40\n\"Take My Breath\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:40\n\"Take My Breath\" (Extended Version) \u2013 5:51\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Dawn Is Coming (Teaser) on YouTube\nThese Track Stars Will Take Your Breath Away - The Weeknd x NBC Sports for Tokyo Olympics 2020 on YouTube\nTake My Breath (Official Audio) on YouTube\nTake My Breath (Official Lyric Video) on YouTube\nTake My Breath (Instrumental) (Official Audio) on YouTube\nTake My Breath (XO Lens) on YouTube\nTake My Breath (Extended Version) (Official Audio) on YouTube\nTake My Breath (Official Agents Of Time Remix Music Video) on YouTube",

            "\"Inferno\" (stylized in all caps) is the second single by Filipino-American social media personality Bella Poarch and seventh single by American musician and producer Sub Urban, released through Warner Records on August 13, 2021. The song follows the May 2021 release of Poarch's debut single \"Build a Bitch\".\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nIn early August 2021, Poarch announced she would release a new single on August 13. The announcement was accompanied by a 30-second video teaser featuring cameo appearances by producer Sub Urban along with Twitch streamers Adin Ross, Disguised Toast, Ludwig, and TommyInnit.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\"Inferno\" was described as \"another dark pop offering\" from Poarch, featuring \"heavy beats and the chilling sound of creepy children singing\". The track also includes \"theatrical and classical elements and a hint of tango\" with lyrics about Poarch's \"troubled past\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nIn a statement, Poarch included a trigger warning for the music video. She wrote, \"As a victim of sexual assault, this song and video mean a lot to me. This is something I haven't been ready to share with you just yet. It's very hard for me to talk about. But I'm ready now. I decided to express myself by creating a song and video with Sub Urban based on how I wished my experience went. It's a fantasy I wish was true. I'm looking forward to sharing this with you all.\" The video takes place in a Hollywood glamor-themed hotel in which Poarch is drugged by two men and pulled into an elevator. Upon entering the elevator, she develops superpowers and tortures the men, whilst Sub Urban, a bartender, makes sure nobody sees.  She is later revealed to be the devil herself, with Sub Urban as Virgil, who takes the offending men through the 9 Circles of Hell by Dante\u2019s Inferno. The music video includes cameos from LilyPichu, Valkyrae, Adin Ross, Disguised Toast, Ludwig Ahgren, Pokimane, TommyInnit, CouRageJD, Ivana Alawi, and Bretman Rock.\n\n\n== Chart Performance ==\nIn Canada the Song peaked at 61 on the Canadian Hot 100. In the Us the song failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100 but instead entered the Bubbling Under Hot 100 and peaked at number 4, however it was more successful in Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart peaking at number 12. In Australia, the song peaked at 98 on the ARIA chart; however, it failed to enter the top 50 on the chart. The song charted also on the Global 200 peaking at 103. The song also entered the CIS Tophit chart peaking 243. In New Zealand, the song was also successful peaking at 13 on the New Zealand Hot Singles chart.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Thats What I Want\" (stylized in all caps) is a song by American rapper and singer Lil Nas X, released through Columbia Records on September 17, 2021, as the fourth single from his debut studio album Montero (2021). It is a pop and pop rock song with elements of power pop, while the rapper is singing about wanting love.

The song's release was accompanied by a Stillz-directed music video featuring the rapper falling in love with a football player. It contains a cameo from Billy Porter and an homage to the 2005 film Brokeback Mountain. Lil Nas X performed this song for the first time on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. It became a top ten hit in 10 countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Thats What I Want\" was written by Lil Nas X, and song's producers: Omer Fedi, Blake Slatkin, Ryan Tedder, and KBeaZy. It is a pop and pop-rock song backed-up by acoustic guitar, \"breezy\" rhythm, \"acoustic strums and hand claps and raindrop-bloopy synth notes.\" The song was compared by the critics to Sum 41's \"Underclass Hero\" (2007), Taylor Swift's \"Shake It Off\" (2014) and the Kid Laroi's collaboration with Justin Bieber \"Stay\" (2021). The track begins with the rapper stating \"Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night.\" The song's chorus is accompanied by \"power pop\" background choir and it sees Lil Nas X singing that he wants to have a lover.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nLil Nas X first previewed the song on TikTok on February 14, 2021. On August 26, 2021, Lil Nas X published another Montero announcement in a form of news, with \"Thats What I Want\" playing in the background. Hours before the album's release, the rapper uploaded a video on his YouTube channel entitled The Montero Show, where he presents his music videos from the least to the most favorite, but when he is about to announce the \"Thats What I Want\" video his water breaks. Deryck Whibley and Jason McCaslin talks about the Underclass Hero single of the song from the video. With the album's release, the song has been announced as its fourth single. On the same day it received airplay premiere on Australian mainstream radio station The Music Network and British BBC Radio 1. It impacted pop radios in Italy and the United States on September 24 and 28 respectively. Later it was sent to the US rhythmic contemporary stations on October 5. He debuted this song live on September 22, 2021, for BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nCarl Wilson from Slate stated that \"Thats What I Want\" is a \"fantastic\" song and an \"anthem of same-sex longing\"; while Mike Wass of Variety called it \"toe-tapper with massive radio appeal\". Its chorus has been described as \"indelible\" by The Guardian's Alexis Petridis, \"snappy\" by Gil Kaufman of Billboard, and \"stirring\" in an article published on Entertainment Weekly by Maura Johnston. Calling its beat \"infectious\", David Smyth of Evening Standard said that Lil Nas X could have made the pronouns ambiguous for \"mass appeal\", but opposing to that he made the song \"[ring] completely true\". Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan assigned to the song adjectives such as \"playful\", \"hopeful\", \"sweet\", and \"proud\"; while New Statesman's Emily Bootle described it as an \"innocent, emotive love song\". Zoya Raza-Sheikh from Gay Times said it is a \"soaring track packed with unapologetic queer heartache that builds the record's momentum\". In an article published by Billboard in late September 2021, the song was described as \"designed to be a charts favorite\" by Stephen Daw, while Jason Lipshutz said that it \"functions as a spiritual sequel to 'Montero (Call Me By Your Name)' (2021)\".\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Thats What I Want\" debuted at number 10 on Billboard Hot 100 on the chart issued October 2, 2021, giving Lil Nas X his third top ten debut and fifth top ten hit. It later peaked at number eight on the chart issued April 2, 2022. It charted within the top ten with the album's previous singles \"Montero (Call Me By Your Name)\" and \"Industry Baby\", giving the rapper his first time where three of his songs were simultaneously within top ten. It also appeared at number 5 on Streaming Songs chart with 24.2 million streams. Additionally, \u201cThats What I Want\u201d debuted on the Mainstream Top 40 chart at number 34 and reached number one on the chart dated February 19, 2022, becoming Lil Nas X\u2019s third consecutive number one single on the chart. The song also went on to become his first multi-week chart topper on the Pop Airplay chart, retaining the top spot for 4 non-consecutive weeks.It also debuted on Billboard's global charts, at number 4 on the main chart, while logging at number 8 on Excluding US chart with 39.6 million streams from outside the US.Elsewhere, \"Thats What I Want\" became highest debut in UK Singles Chart on chart issue September 30, 2021, logging at number 10. It was also placed at number 7 on ARIA Singles Chart.\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\nThe music video for \"Thats What I Want\" was directed by STILLZ and produced by Esteban Zuluaga, Malcolm Duncan, and Fabien Colas which premiered on September 17, 2021. During a football game at the fictional Montero University, whose players wear pink uniforms, Lil Nas X falls from the sky to crash on the field, causing him to injure his knee. As he is taken off the field, he meets the eyes of another player, played by Yai Ariza. The two of them meet alone in the locker room, where they begin to kiss. Later they are seen in a passionate sex scene in the shower, with Lil Nas X opening a Durex condom package.In the second verse, the pair are seen next to a campfire in cowboy outfits as well as being intimate in a tent; the scene is a homage to Brokeback Mountain (2005). Next, Lil Nas X goes to the other man's house with flowers, only to discover he is married to a woman and has a child. Lil Nas X drives home in anguish, gets drunk, and eventually passes out. At the end of the video, Lil Nas X enters a church wearing a white wedding gown and walks down the aisle in tears. At the alter a priest, played by Billy Porter, gives him an electric guitar, on which Lil Nas X plays a solo.Kaufman described the video as \"steamy, drama-filled\", adding that it is \"fittingly high drama visual for an album that has already given us some other iconic videos for 'Industry Baby' and 'Montero (Call Me By Your Name).'\" Writing for The Fader, Shaad D'Souza described it as \"raunchy\" and \"cinematic.\" Wilson said that it is \"tour de force performance of in-your-face queerness.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Smokin Out the Window\" is the third single by American superduo Silk Sonic, consisting of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, released on November 5, 2021, by Aftermath Entertainment and Atlantic Records as the third single from Silk Sonic's debut studio album, An Evening with Silk Sonic (2021). \"Smokin Out the Window\" was written by .Paak, Mars, and D'Mile, while the production was handled by the latter two.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn early 2017, after .Paak and Mars met on tour, they decided to get together in the studio with no intent, besides their mutual appreciation and affection. At this point, the duo decided to try if they could turn the \"backstage in-jokes\" into songs. The first thing they wrote together started with one of them saying the sentence \"Smoking out the window\". They created an amusing \"stressed-out\" man smoking too many cigarettes as he tries to find his way out of \"anxious\" situations when they got together in the studio the \"joke\" was turned into a hook. Once the tour ended, the sessions were put on hold.\n\n\n== Release ==\nOn November 5, 2021, \"Smokin Out the Window\" was released as the third single from An Evening with Silk Sonic via digital download and streaming services in various countries by Aftermath Entertainment and Atlantic Records. On the same date, Warner Music Group also issued the track to be added to Italian contemporary hit radio. American adult contemporary radio stations began adding the track onto their playlists on November 8, 2021, through Atlantic Records, and it was released to US contemporary hit radio on November 9, 2021, through the aforementioned label.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\"Smokin Out the Window\" was written by Mars, Paak and Dernst Emile II. The production was handled by Mars and D' Mile. The former played the guitar and was in charge of the percussion, while the latter played the bass and piano. Bootsy Collins vocals were recorded by Tobe Donohue at Rehab Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio. Homer Steinweiss played drums, while Ella Feingold was in charge of the vibraphone. The horn section had Kameron Whalum playing the trombone, Marc Franklin the trumpet, Kirk Smothers playing the alto and bari sax and Lannie McMillan the tenor sax. The horns were recorded by Boo Mitchell at Royal Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. The drums were recorded by Jens Jungkurth at The Legendary Diamond Mine, Long Island City, New York. Larry Gold did the arrangement and conduction of the strings at Milk Boy Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with Jeff Chestek recording it. Blake Espy, Emma Kummrow and Christopher Jusell played the violin with Natasha Colkett, Tess Varley and Luigi Mazzocchi, Jonathan Kim and Yoshihiko Nakano were responsible for the viola and Glenn Fischbach played the cello. Charles Moniz, with engineering assistant Alex Resoagli, engineered and recorded the song at Shampoo Press & Curl Studios. Serban Ghenea mixed \"Leave the Door Open\" at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, with John Hanes serving as the mix engineer and Bryce Bordone as mixing assistant. It was mastered by Randy Merrill at Sterling Sound, NYC.\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\nThe music video for \"Smokin Out the Window\" premiered alongside the song's release on November 5, 2021, and was directed by Mars and John Esparza.< In the video, the duo perform on a stage decorated with large light-up stars, alongside backup singers and a band. Originally, Silk Sonic teased their fans by tweeting out a muted clip of an alternate music video, showing the duo driving downtown as they sing the vocals, all the while smoking and munching on pizza. It turns out that this clip was actually lip-synced to the second chorus of the song.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nThe song was listed by Billboard publication as being among the best songs of the year. On the Billboard 100 Best Songs of 2021, the single was placed at number 63 the list. Rania Aniftos wrote \"the success of \"Smokin Out the Window\" can be attributed to the fact that Silk Sonic can make calling a woman \"this b\u2014h\" weirdly attractive\".\n\n\n== Live performances and other usage ==\nOn November 21, 2021, \"Smokin Out the Window\" was performed live for the first time, as the opening act of that year's American Music Awards. Just a week later, it would be performed at the 2021 Soul Train Music Awards, alongside \"Fly as Me\". Mars and .Paak also performed the song during their concert residency An Evening With Silk Sonic at Park MGM (2022).\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of An Evening with Silk Sonic.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_(Billie_Eilish_song)",
            "\"Lost Cause\" is a song by American singer Billie Eilish. It was released on June 2, 2021, through Darkroom and Interscope as the fourth single from her second studio album Happier Than Ever (2021). The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 27.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn May 28, 2021, pop singer Billie Eilish shared a silent five second video of herself looking off-camera on Instagram. She wrote in the caption: \"New song out next week.\" Eilish's brother, singer and producer Finneas O'Connell confirmed the release as well, posting on his Twitter account, \"New billie song coming very soon.\" On May 31, 2021, Eilish took to Instagram to share different photos of herself and one of a car wheel with the caption: \"Nothing but a lost cause.\" On June 1, 2021, the singer announced on her social media accounts that \"Lost Cause\" would be released on June 2, 2021, and that it would be the fourth single off of her upcoming sophomore studio album Happier Than Ever (2021). Along with the same announcement, Eilish revealed the music video for the song would be released on the same day.\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n\"Lost Cause\" is a mid-tempo \"trip-hop adjacent\" soft rock song which consists of jazz-inspired minimalistic instrumentation. According to Madison Vain of Esquire, the song is lined with \"reverb-soaked acoustic guitar\", and noted the lyrics: \"I know you think you're such an outlaw\" are a \"direct call back\" to her 2019 number one hit single \"Bad Guy\". Ethan Shanfeld for Variety said Eilish \"croons over a slinky bass line and laid back drum beat\".Wren Graves for Consequence said Eilish shows off her \"smoky voice over a restrained track that offers little more than sly bass behind her\". Heran Mamo of Billboard stated the \"sultry kiss-off\" song lets Eilish's \"former love interest know she sees right through him and notices he's nothing but a lost cause\", while Zoe Haylock of Vulture opined Eilish \"sings about moving on from an ex\". Brenton Blanchet of Complex mentioned Eilish sings of a \"jobless man who couldn't even bring her flowers\". Rolling Stone's Claire Shaffer writes that the artist was \"taking someone down a peg for their apathy\"; Shaffer placed emphasis on the lyrics \"You ain't nothing but a lost cause/And this ain't nothing like it once was\" and \"I know you think you're such an outlaw/But you got no job.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nP. Claire Dodson of Teen Vogue compared the track to Eilish's previous single \"Your Power\" (2021), describing the latter as \"more vulnerable [and] airy\" while saying the former is a \"lighter, more playful type of roast\". Coco Romack of MTV described the song as a \"low-key empowerment anthem\" and compared it to R&B girl group TLC's 1999 single \"No Scrubs\" and English singer Dua Lipa's 2017 single \"New Rules\". James Rettig for Stereogum called the track \"breezy and laidback\". Stephanie Eckardt of W mentioned that \"Lost Cause\" is just the \"latest indication of where [Eilish]'s headed next leading up to the release of her long-awaited sophomore album Happier Than Ever\". Gabrielle Sanchez for The A.V. Club opined Eilish is known for \"clinging to the melancholy, whispering sad tales of monsters under the bed\" but explained the song sees her \"looking happier than she's ever been\". Joe Smith of Gigwise stated that \"Lost Cause\" is a \"groovy and subdued effort from Eilish that captures exactly what made her so popular in the first place\".\n\n\n== Release and chart performance ==\n\"Lost Cause\" was released to digital download and streaming media on June 2, 2021. It was serviced to contemporary hit radio stations only in Australia and Russia later the month. Due to lack of major radio push and unusual Wednesday release, the single didn't manage to catch same success of its predecessors, being first single of Happier Than Ever was never charted to top 10 in the US. The song debuted and peaked at number 27 on Billboard Hot 100 on chart issue June 19, 2021. Staying yet two weeks on the chart, the song dropped of it after just three weeks; it re-entered after album's release at number 84.With just two days of tracktions, \"Lost Cause\" debuted at position 125 on Billboard Global 200 chart, eventually peaking at 15 week later on chart issue dated June 19, 2021. It debuted at number 14 on UK Singles Chart, becoming Eilish's eleventh top 40 single there, it also became the highest new entry on Irish Singles Chart on June 11. In Australia, the song became second highest new entry on the chart, debuting at number 18, and staying continuously on the ARIA Singles Chart for three weeks, returning to the list after album's release at 46.\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\n\n=== Background and synopsis ===\nA music video for the song was released the same day as the single. The video was solely directed by Eilish, and was shot on April 22, 2021. A day later, the singer uploaded a behind-the-scenes video to TikTok for the visual. It shows Eilish and her backup dancers having to go from kneeling on the floor to standing and jumping around while making sure their clothes were kept in place. Derrick Rossignol from Uproxx stated Eilish's chest \"was exposed than she apparently wanted the world to see, so she covered it with an emoji and wrote in text superimposed onto the video, 'titties was [sic] falling out'\".In the music video, Eilish invites a group of women for a day party in a Los Angeles mansion to do some interpretive dance moves around a king sized bed, move in and out of walk-in closets, twerk, play Twister, spray silly string, shoot water guns, drink orange soda, and eat potato chips. Eilish wears an oversized beige tee and matching cream bike shorts by Skims, while her friends wear tank tops and sweaters. Eilish then changes into a blue camisole, shorts, and robe, while her friends wear \"slinky pieces\" in pastel blues and grays.\n\n\n=== Reception and controversy ===\nChristian Allaire of Vogue stated the \"matchy-matchy outfits are what truly make this slumber party soir\u00e9e one to remember\". Jordan Darville of The Fader and Brit Dawson of Dazed compared the visual to R&B singer Beyonc\u00e9's 2014 single \"7/11\"'s music video. The staff of DIY mentioned the video has a \"color-coordinated and immaculately-choreographed slumber party\". Mia Mercado for The Cut opined the visual \"can be best summarized as a giant (kinda horny?) sleepover\".Due to the sexual nature of the music video and that it only features women, following its release fans and media started speculating about Eilish's sexuality, with some being positive and congratulating the artist for coming out, while others started accusing the artist of queerbaiting. However allegations of queerbaiting escalated on June 10, when the singer posted on Instagram behind-the-scenes photos of the music video shoot with the caption \"i love girls.\" It is the second time that the star has been accused of that, following her 2019 single \"Wish You Were Gay\". Three days later, the singer uploaded a selfie to her Instagram with captioned \"I'm tired.\" Some fans and publications defended Eilish, while others still saw her actions as inappropriate.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The song later rose to reach a peak of number two following the release of the remix. It also debuted at number five on the Billboard Global 200, becoming Grande's second top ten single on the chart; it later reached a peak of number two there. Additionally, \"34+35\" peaked within the top ten in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom, giving Grande her 19th top ten single in the latter.\nIts music video, directed by Director X, premiered on November 17, 2020. A remix of the song, featuring American rappers Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion, was released on January 15, 2021. A live performance music video of \"34+35\" was released on July 15, 2021.\n\n\n== Background and promotion ==\nI just think it's ridiculous, so funny and stupid. We heard the strings that sounded so Disney and orchestral, and full and pure. And I was just like, \"Yo, what's the dirtiest possible, most opposing lyric that we could write to this?\"\n\"34+35\" was first revealed when Grande announced the track list of Positions via social media on October 24, 2020. Grande started working on the song in 2019, and finished it in September 2020 after she decided it was going to be on the album. It was originally intended to be the lead single before being replaced by title track \"Positions\", after Grande decided that it was more appropriate as it gave a more accurate representation of the album. Given the explicit nature of the song, which has been compared to Grande's past works such as \"Side to Side\" and \"Dangerous Woman\", Grande said that she was \"very nervous\" about the song initially, fearing that it would \"distract from the vulnerability and the sweetness that is the rest of the album\". She stated that it was sonically \"one of [her] favorite things [she and her team have] ever done\", adding: \"it deserve[d] a home on the album for sure...I think that everything I do has a little bit of humor, and the people know that I'm not really sitting here 'til dawn.\"To promote the song, Grande released a \"34+35 dad hat\" on her official merchandise store, which features \"34+35\" graphics embroidered on the front of a baseball cap. \"34+35\" was sent to contemporary hit radio in Australia and the United States on October 30 and November 3, 2020, respectively. A lyric video was released on YouTube on October 30, 2020.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"34+35\" is an uptempo song written with a tempo of 110 beats per minute in the key of F major, while Grande's vocals range from a low note of G3 to a high note of D5. The song's lyrics include sexual puns, double entendres, and sex jokes, while the song's title (which, as a mathematical expression, evaluates to 69) and chorus reference the sex position 69, with the outro's lyrics including \"Means I wanna 69 witcha\". Other lyrics include explicit sexual references, such as \"Can you stay up all night?/Fuck me 'til the daylight\". The song was written about Grande's sex life with her boyfriend Dalton Gomez. According to Grande, the line, \"Just gimme them babies\" was suggested by songwriter Scott Nicholson as a joke to complete the first verse, on the night they started writing the song, but she liked it so much that it ended up in the final version. The earthquake referenced in the third verse (\"Got the neighbours yellin' \"Earthquake!\"/4.5 when I make the bed shake\") was based on an actual earthquake of magnitude 4.5 that occurred in Southern California in September 2020. Grande wrote the bridge together with songwriters Tayla Parx and Victoria Mon\u00e9t.Mary Siroky of Consequence of Sound called the track \"overwhelmingly playful\" and \"no-holds-barred\", with Heather Taylor-Singh of Exclaim! writing that it featured an \"overt sexiness\". Adam White of The Independent called the song's lyrics \"dirty-minded\" and \"cutely tongue-in-cheek\", while Brenton Blanchet of Clash regarded \"34+35\" as \"Grande's most sexually explicit track yet\". Similarly, Natalie Morin of Refinery29 named the song \"Grande's sex magnum opus\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nOn his ranking of every song on Positions, where \"34+35\" was positioned at number two, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard praised Grande for being one of the \"few artists working today [who] could release an explicit sex track that sounds this luxurious and ornately detailed\", describing the song as \"unapologetic and dizzyingly fun, with Grande shrugging off the need for euphemism and rightfully confident in her approach\". Writing for The Line of Best Fit, Ross Horton identified \"34+35\" as the best song on and the \"mission statement\" for the album, writing that \"the amount of puns, double entendres and jokes littered throughout is staggering\". Brenton Blanchet of Clash wrote that the song \"hits just as hard as its lyrical prowess\", calling it the \"baby-making-ist track\" on Positions and referring to its \"NSFW\" chorus as \"addictive\".Variety's Chris Willman remarked that \"34+35\" was \"a little bit on the schoolgirl-sniggering side\" and that the outro's literalization of the song's 69 joke was \"unnecessary\". Shaad D'Souza of The Fader referred to the song as a \"hammy ode to 69-ing\" which \"makes no attempts at even the most vaguely clever innuendo\". Slant Magazine's Alexa Camp considered the song's lyrics \"a lot of empty pillow talk and plentiful dog whistles.\" Emma Madden of Entertainment Weekly criticized the song's lyrics, writing, \"Grande sings that she was 'never good' in math class on '34+35,' and it seems she might be equally bad at math-related wordplay.\"\n\n\n=== Year-end lists ===\nUproxx ranked \"34+35\" as the 9th best song of 2020, with Caitlin White commenting that the song is more carefree and funnier than the lead single \"Positions\", and that it \"has all the makings of a late album hit, and will go down in Ari's catalogue as one of her most clever offerings\". LaTesha Harris from NPR ranked \"34+35\" as the 8th best song of 2020. Tidal ranked \"34+35\" as the 32nd best pop song of 2020. Jessica McKinney of Complex ranked \"34+35\" as the 42nd best song of 2020. Calling its production \"immaculate\", she commented that the song is \"sexually explicit, seductive, luxurious, and elegant, guided by Grande's sultry vocals\".\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\nFollowing the release of Positions, \"34+35\" debuted at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart issue dated November 14, 2020, drawing in 21.7 million streams, 5.7 million airplay audience impressions and 3,000 digital downloads sold within its first tracking week.

Insider's Callie Ahlgrim dubbed the remix version as \"cheeky\".\n\n\n=== Music video ===\nOn February 1, 2021, Grande teased a music video with two pictures posted to her social media. On February 5, Grande, Doja Cat and Megan all posted the same picture of them in lingerie to social media, hinting at a possible video. On February 9, Grande confirmed the music video and announced that it was scheduled for release on February 12, 2021. It was directed by Stefan Kohli.The music video begins with Grande at a swimming pool reclining on a lawn chair reading a magazine while swans float by. The camera zooms out to reveal Doja Cat and Megan on two other lawn chairs. All acts later drink champagne. After Doja Cat's verse, Grande orders room service through an intercom. During her verse, Megan is twerking in a bathtub, and all the artists play around with a camcorder in bed. Grande is wearing Victoria's Secret Lace Plunge Teddy lingerie throughout most of the video.Steffanie Wang of Nylon summarised that in the video all acts are \"serving nothing but looks and aspirational lifestyle goals.\" Billboard's Katie Atkinson called the video \"perfect girls' day video.\"\n\n\n=== Credits and personnel ===\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n=== Charts ===\n\n\n=== Certifications ===\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Billboard Hot 100 top-ten singles in 2020\nList of Billboard Hot 100 top-ten singles in 2021\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAudio on YouTube\nLyric video on YouTube\nRemix lyric video on YouTube",

            "Zen (Chinese: \u79aa; pinyin: Ch\u00e1n; Japanese: \u7985, romanized: zen; Korean: \uc120, romanized: Seon; Vietnamese: Thi\u1ec1n) is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty, known as the Chan School (Ch\u00e1nzong \u79aa\u5b97), and later developed into various sub-schools and branches.

The Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 literature as well as Madhyamaka thought have also been influential in the shaping of the apophatic and sometimes iconoclastic nature of Zen rhetoric.Furthermore, the Chan School was also influenced by Taoist philosophy, especially Neo-Daoist thought.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation (kana: \u305c\u3093) of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa (Middle Chinese: [d\u0291ian]; pinyin: Ch\u00e1n), which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word dhy\u0101na (\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928), which can be approximately translated as \"absorption\" or \"meditative state\".The actual Chinese term for the \"Zen school\" is \u79aa\u5b97 (pinyin: Ch\u00e1nz\u014dng), while \"Chan\" just refers to the practice of meditation itself (Chinese: \u7fd2\u79aa; pinyin: x\u00edch\u00e1n) or the study of meditation (Chinese: \u79aa\u5b78; pinyin: ch\u00e1nxu\u00e9) though it is often used as an abbreviated form of Ch\u00e1nzong.\"Zen\" is traditionally a proper noun as it usually describes a particular Buddhist sect. In more recent times, the lowercase \"zen\" is used when discussing the philosophy and was officially added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 2018.\n\n\n== Practice ==\n\n\n=== Dhy\u0101na ===\n\nThe practice of dhyana or meditation, especially sitting meditation (\u5750\u79aa\uff0cChinese: zu\u00f2ch\u00e1n, Japanese: zazen / \u3056\u305c\u3093) is a central part of Zen Buddhism.\n\n\n==== Chinese Buddhism ====\nThe practice of Buddhist meditation first entered China through the translations of An Shigao (fl. c. 148\u2013180 CE), and Kum\u0101raj\u012bva (334\u2013413 CE), who both translated Dhy\u0101na sutras, which were influential early meditation texts mostly based on the Yogacara (yoga praxis) teachings of the Kashmiri Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da circa 1st\u20134th centuries CE. Among the most influential early Chinese meditation texts include the Anban Shouyi Jing (\u5b89\u822c\u5b88\u610f\u7d93, Sutra on \u0101n\u0101p\u0101nasm\u1e5bti), the Zuochan Sanmei Jing (\u5750\u79aa\u4e09\u6627\u7d93\uff0cSutra of sitting dhy\u0101na sam\u0101dhi) and the Damoduoluo Chan Jing (\u9054\u6469\u591a\u7f85\u79aa\u7d93, Dharmatrata dhy\u0101na sutra). These early Chinese meditation works continued to exert influence on Zen practice well into the modern era. For example, the 18th century Rinzai Zen master T\u014drei Enji wrote a commentary on the Damoduoluo Chan Jing and used the Zuochan Sanmei Jing as source in the writing of this commentary. T\u014drei believed that the Damoduoluo Chan Jing had been authored by Bodhidharma.While dhy\u0101na in a strict sense refers to the four dhy\u0101nas, in Chinese Buddhism, dhy\u0101na may refer to various kinds of meditation techniques and their preparatory practices, which are necessary to practice dhy\u0101na. The five main types of meditation in the Dhy\u0101na sutras are \u0101n\u0101p\u0101nasm\u1e5bti (mindfulness of breathing); pa\u1e6dik\u016blamanasik\u0101ra meditation (mindfulness of the impurities of the body); maitr\u012b meditation (loving-kindness); the contemplation on the twelve links of prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da; and contemplation on the Buddha. According to the modern Chan master Sheng Yen, these practices are termed the \"five methods for stilling or pacifying the mind\" and serve to focus and purify the mind, and support the development of the stages of dhyana. Chan also shares the practice of the four foundations of mindfulness and the Three Gates of Liberation (emptyness or \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101, signlessness or animitta, and wishlessness or apra\u1e47ihita) with early Buddhism and classic Mahayana.\n\n\n==== Pointing to the nature of the mind ====\nAccording to Charles Luk, in the earliest traditions of Ch\u00e1n, there was no fixed method or formula for teaching meditation, and all instructions were simply heuristic methods, to point to the true nature of the mind, also known as Buddha-nature. According to Luk, this method is referred to as the \"Mind Dharma\", and exemplified in the story (in the Flower Sermon) of \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha holding up a flower silently, and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa smiling as he understood. A traditional formula of this is, \"Ch\u00e1n points directly to the human mind, to enable people to see their true nature and become buddhas.\"\n\n\n==== Observing the mind ====\nAccording to John R. McRae the \"first explicit statement of the sudden and direct approach that was to become the hallmark of Ch'an religious practice\" is associated with the East Mountain School. It is a method named \"Maintaining the one without wavering\" (shou-i pu i, \u5b88\u4e00\u4e0d\u79fb), the one being the nature of mind, which is equated with Buddha-nature. According to Sharf, in this practice, one turns the attention from the objects of experience, to the nature of mind, the perceiving subject itself, which is equated with Buddha-nature. According to McRae, this type of meditation resembles the methods of \"virtually all schools of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism,\" but differs in that \"no preparatory requirements, no moral prerequisites or preliminary exercises are given,\" and is \"without steps or gradations. One concentrates, understands, and is enlightened, all in one undifferentiated practice.\" Sharf notes that the notion of \"Mind\" came to be criticised by radical subitists, and was replaced by \"No Mind,\" to avoid any reifications.\n\n\n==== Meditation manuals ====\nEarly Chan texts also teach forms of meditation that are unique to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, for example, the Treatise on the Essentials of Cultivating the Mind, which depicts the teachings of the 7th-century East Mountain school teaches a visualization of a sun disk, similar to that taught in the Sutra of the Contemplation of the Buddha Amit\u00e1yus.Later Chinese Buddhists developed their own meditation manuals and texts, one of the most influential being the works of the Tiantai patriarch, Zhiyi. His works seemed to have exerted some influence on the earliest meditation manuals of the Ch\u00e1n school proper, an early work being the widely imitated and influential Tso-chan-i (Principles of sitting meditation, c. 11th century).\n\n\n=== Common contemporary meditation forms ===\n\n\n==== Mindfulness of breathing ====\n\nDuring sitting meditation (\u5750\u7985, Ch. zu\u00f2ch\u00e1n, Jp. zazen, Ko. jwaseon), practitioners usually assume a position such as the lotus position, half-lotus, Burmese, or seiza, often using the dhy\u0101na mudr\u0101. Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used.\nTo regulate the mind, Zen students are often directed towards counting breaths. Either both exhalations and inhalations are counted, or one of them only. The count can be up to ten, and then this process is repeated until the mind is calmed. Zen teachers like Omori Sogen teach a series of long and deep exhalations and inhalations as a way to prepare for regular breath meditation. Attention is usually placed on the energy center (dantian) below the navel. Zen teachers often promote diaphragmatic breathing, stating that the breath must come from the lower abdomen (known as hara or tanden in Japanese), and that this part of the body should expand forward slightly as one breathes. Over time the breathing should become smoother, deeper and slower. When the counting becomes an encumbrance, the practice of simply following the natural rhythm of breathing with concentrated attention is recommended.\n\n\n==== Silent Illumination and shikantaza ====\nA common form of sitting meditation is called \"Silent illumination\" (Ch. m\u00f2zh\u00e0o, Jp. mokush\u014d). This practice was traditionally promoted by the Caodong school of Chinese Chan and is associated with Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091\u20141157) who wrote various works on the practice. This method derives from the Indian Buddhist practice of the union (Skt. yuganaddha) of \u015bamatha and vipa\u015byan\u0101.In Hongzhi's practice of \"nondual objectless meditation\" the mediator strives to be aware of the totality of phenomena instead of focusing on a single object, without any interference, conceptualizing, grasping, goal seeking, or subject-object duality.This practice is also popular in the major schools of Japanese Zen, but especially S\u014dt\u014d, where it is more widely known as Shikantaza (Ch. zh\u01d0gu\u01cen d\u01cezu\u00f2, \"Just sitting\"). Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of the practice can be found throughout the work of the Japanese S\u014dt\u014d Zen thinker D\u014dgen, especially in his Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d, for example in the \"Principles of Zazen\" and the \"Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen\". While the Japanese and the Chinese forms are similar, they are distinct approaches.\n\n\n==== Hua Tou and K\u014dan contemplation ====\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, g\u014dng'\u00e0n (Jp. k\u014dan) literature became popular. Literally meaning \"public case\", they were stories or dialogues, describing teachings and interactions between Zen masters and their students. These anecdotes give a demonstration of the master's insight. K\u014dan are meant to illustrate the non-conceptual insight (praj\u00f1a) that the Buddhist teachings point to. During the S\u00f2ng dynasty, a new meditation method was popularized by figures such as Dahui, which was called kanhua chan (\"observing the phrase\" meditation), which referred to contemplation on a single word or phrase (called the huatou, \"critical phrase\") of a g\u014dng'\u00e0n. In Chinese Chan and Korean Seon, this practice of \"observing the huatou\" (hwadu in Korean) is a widely practiced method. It was taught by the influential Seon master Chinul (1158\u20131210), and modern Chinese masters like Sheng Yen and Xuyun. Yet, while Dahui famously criticised \"silent illumination,\" he nevertheless \"did not completely condemn quiet-sitting; in fact, he seems to have recommended it, at least to his monastic disciples.\"In the Japanese Rinzai school, k\u014dan introspection developed its own formalized style, with a standardized curriculum of k\u014dans, which must be studied and \"passed\" in sequence. This process includes standardized \"checking questions\" (sassho) and common sets of \"capping phrases\" (jakugo) or poetry citations that are memorized by students as answers. The Zen student's mastery of a given k\u014dan is presented to the teacher in a private interview (referred to in Japanese as dokusan, daisan, or sanzen). While there is no unique answer to a k\u014dan, practitioners are expected to demonstrate their spiritual understanding through their responses. The teacher may approve or disapprove of the answer and guide the student in the right direction. The interaction with a teacher is central in Zen, but makes Zen practice also vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation. K\u014dan-inquiry may be practiced during zazen (sitting meditation), kinhin (walking meditation), and throughout all the activities of daily life. The goal of the practice is often termed kensho (seeing one's true nature), and is to be followed by further practice to attain a natural, effortless, down-to-earth state of being, the \"ultimate liberation\", \"knowing without any kind of defilement\".K\u014dan practice is particularly emphasized in Rinzai, but it also occurs in other schools or branches of Zen depending on the teaching line.\n\n\n==== Nianfo chan ====\nNianfo (Jp. nembutsu, from Skt. buddh\u0101nusm\u1e5bti \"recollection of the Buddha\") refers to the recitation of the Buddha's name, in most cases the Buddha Amitabha. In Chinese Chan, the Pure Land practice of nianfo based on the phrase N\u0101m\u00f3 \u0100m\u00edtu\u00f3f\u00f3 (Homage to Amitabha) is a widely practiced form of Zen meditation. This practice was adopted from Pure land Buddhism and syncretized with Chan meditation by Chinese figures such as Yongming Yanshou, Zhongfen Mingben, and Tianru Weize. During the late Ming, the harmonization of Pure land practices with Chan meditation was continued by figures such as Yunqi Zhuhong and Hanshan Deqing.This practice, as well as its adaptation into the \"nembutsu k\u014dan\" was also used by the Japanese \u014cbaku school of Zen.\n\n\n=== Bodhisattva virtues and vows ===\n\nSince Zen is a form of Mahayana Buddhism, it is grounded on the schema of the bodhisattva path, which is based on the practice of the \"transcendent virtues\" or \"perfections\" (Skt. p\u0101ramit\u0101, Ch. b\u014dlu\u00f3m\u00ec, Jp. baramitsu) as well as the taking of the bodhisattva vows. The most widely used list of six virtues is: generosity, moral training (incl. five precepts), patient endurance, energy or effort, meditation (dhyana), wisdom. An important source for these teachings is the Avatamsaka sutra, which also outlines the grounds (bhumis) or levels of the bodhisattva path. The p\u0101ramit\u0101s are mentioned in early Chan works such as Bodhidharma's Two entrances and four practices and are seen as an important part of gradual cultivation (jianxiu) by later Chan figures like Zongmi.An important element of this practice is the formal and ceremonial taking of refuge in the three jewels, bodhisattva vows and precepts. Various sets of precepts are taken in Zen including the five precepts, \"ten essential precepts\", and the sixteen bodhisattva precepts. This is commonly done in an initiation ritual (Ch. sh\u00f2u ji\u00e8, Jp. Jukai, Ko. sugye, \"receiving the precepts\"), which is also undertaken by lay followers and marks a layperson as a formal Buddhist.The Chinese Buddhist practice of fasting (zhai), especially during the uposatha days (Ch. zhairi, \"days of fasting\") can also be an element of Chan training. Chan masters may go on extended absolute fasts, as exemplified by master Hsuan Hua's 35 day fast, which he undertook during the Cuban missile crisis for the generation of merit.\n\n\n=== Physical cultivation ===\n\nTraditional martial arts, like Japanese archery, other forms of Japanese bud\u014d and Chinese martial arts (g\u014dngfu) have also been seen as forms of zen praxis. This tradition goes back to the influential Shaolin Monastery in Henan, which developed the first institutionalized form of g\u014dngfu. By the late Ming, Shaolin g\u014dngfu was very popular and widespread, as evidenced by mentions in various forms of Ming literature (featuring staff wielding fighting monks like Sun Wukong) and historical sources, which also speak of Shaolin's impressive monastic army that rendered military service to the state in return for patronage. These Shaolin practices, which began to develop around the 12th century, were also traditionally seen as a form of Chan Buddhist inner cultivation (today called wuchan, \"martial chan\"). The Shaolin arts also made use of Taoist physical exercises (taoyin) breathing and energy cultivation (q\u00ecg\u014dng) practices. They were seen as therapeutic practices, which improved \"internal strength\" (neili), health and longevity (lit. \"nourishing life\" yangsheng), as well as means to spiritual liberation.The influence of these Taoist practices can be seen in the work of Wang Zuyuan (ca. 1820\u2013after 1882), a scholar and minor bureaucrat who studied at Shaolin. Wang's Illustrated Exposition of Internal Techniques (Neigong tushuo) shows how Shaolin exercises were drawn from Taoist methods like those of the Yi jin jing and Eight pieces of brocade, possibly influenced by the Ming dynasty's spirit of religious syncretism. According to the modern Chan master Sheng Yen, Chinese Buddhism has adopted internal cultivation exercises from the Shaolin tradition as ways to \"harmonize the body and develop concentration in the midst of activity.\" This is because, \"techniques for harmonizing the vital energy are powerful assistants to the cultivation of samadhi and spiritual insight.\" Korean Seon also has developed a similar form of active physical training, termed Sunmudo.\n\nIn Japan, the classic combat arts (bud\u014d) and zen practice have been in contact since the embrace of Rinzai Zen by the H\u014dj\u014d clan in the 13th century, who applied zen discipline to their martial practice. One influential figure in this relationship was the Rinzai priest Takuan S\u014dh\u014d who was well known for his writings on zen and bud\u014d addressed to the samurai class (especially his The Unfettered Mind) . The Rinzai school also adopted certain Taoist energy practices. They were introduced by Hakuin (1686\u20131769) who learned various techniques from a hermit named Hakuyu who helped Hakuin cure his \"Zen sickness\" (a condition of physical and mental exhaustion). These energetic practices, known as Naikan, are based on focusing the mind and one's vital energy (ki) on the tanden (a spot slightly below the navel).\n\n\n=== The arts ===\n\nCertain arts such as painting, calligraphy, poetry, gardening, flower arrangement, tea ceremony and others have also been used as part of zen training and practice. Classical Chinese arts like brush painting and calligraphy were used by Chan monk painters such as Guanxiu and Muqi Fachang to communicate their spiritual understanding in unique ways to their students. Zen paintings are sometimes termed zenga in Japanese. Hakuin is one Japanese Zen master who was known to create a large corpus of unique sumi-e (ink and wash paintings) and Japanese calligraphy to communicate zen in a visual way. His work and that of his disciples were widely influential in Japanese Zen. Another example of Zen arts can be seen in the short lived Fuke sect of Japanese Zen, which practiced a unique form of \"blowing zen\" (suizen) by playing the shakuhachi bamboo flute.\n\n\n=== Intensive group practice ===\nIntensive group meditation may be practiced by serious Zen practitioners. In the Japanese language, this practice is called sesshin. While the daily routine may require monks to meditate for several hours each day, during the intensive period they devote themselves almost exclusively to zen practice. The numerous 30\u201350 minute long sitting meditation (zazen) periods are interwoven with rest breaks, ritualized formal meals (Jp. oryoki), and short periods of work (Jp. samu) that are to be performed with the same state of mindfulness. In modern Buddhist practice in Japan, Taiwan, and the West, lay students often attend these intensive practice sessions or retreats. These are held at many Zen centers or temples.\n\n\n=== Chanting and rituals ===\n\nMost Zen monasteries, temples and centers perform various rituals, services and ceremonies (such as initiation ceremonies and funerals), which are always accompanied by the chanting of verses, poems or sutras. There are also ceremonies that are specifically for the purpose of sutra recitation (Ch. niansong, Jp. nenju) itself.Zen schools may have an official sutra book that collects these writings (in Japanese, these are called kyohon). Practitioners may chant major Mahayana sutras such as the Heart Sutra and chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra (often called the \"Avalokite\u015bvara Sutra\"). Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012bs and Zen poems may also be part of a Zen temple liturgy, including texts like the Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi, the Sandokai, the N\u012blaka\u1e47\u1e6dha Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b, and the U\u1e63\u1e47\u012b\u1e63a Vijaya Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b S\u016btra.\nThe butsudan is the altar in a monastery, temple or a lay person's home, where offerings are made to the images of the Buddha, bodhisattvas and deceased family members and ancestors. Rituals usually center on major Buddhas or bodhisattvas like Avalokite\u015bvara (see Guanyin), K\u1e63itigarbha and Manjushri.\nAn important element in Zen ritual practice is the performance of ritual prostrations (Jp. raihai) or bows.One popular form of ritual in Japanese Zen is Mizuko kuy\u014d (Water child) ceremonies, which are performed for those who have had a miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion. These ceremonies are also performed in American Zen Buddhism.A widely practiced ritual in Chinese Chan is variously called the \"Rite for releasing the hungry ghosts\" or the \"Releasing flaming mouth\". The ritual might date back to the Tang dynasty, and was very popular during the Ming and Qing dynasties, when Chinese Esoteric Buddhist practices became diffused throughout Chinese Buddhism. The Chinese holiday of the Ghost Festival might also be celebrated with similar rituals for the dead. These ghost rituals are a source of contention in modern Chinese Chan, and masters such as Sheng Yen criticize the practice for not having \"any basis in Buddhist teachings\".Another important type of ritual practiced in Zen are various repentance or confession rituals (Jp. zange) that were widely practiced in all forms of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism. One popular Chan text on this is known as the Emperor Liang Repentance Ritual, composed by Chan master Baozhi. Dogen also wrote a treatise on repentance, the Shushogi. Other rituals could include rites dealing with local deities (kami in Japan), and ceremonies on Buddhist holidays such as Buddha's Birthday.Funerals are also an important ritual and are a common point of contact between Zen monastics and the laity. Statistics published by the S\u014dt\u014d school state that 80 percent of S\u014dt\u014d laymen visit their temple only for reasons having to do with funerals and death. Seventeen percent visit for spiritual reasons and 3 percent visit a Zen priest at a time of personal trouble or crisis.\n\n\n=== Esoteric practices ===\nDepending on the tradition, esoteric methods such as mantra and dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b are also used for different purposes including meditation practice, protection from evil, invoking great compassion, invoking the power of certain bodhisattvas, and are chanted during ceremonies and rituals. In the Kwan Um school of Zen for example, a mantra of Guanyin (\"Kwanseum Bosal\") is used during sitting meditation. The Heart Sutra Mantra is also another mantra that is used in Zen during various rituals. Another example is the Mantra of Light (k\u014dmy\u014d shingon), which is common in Japanese Soto Zen and was derived from the Shingon sect.In Chinese Chan, the usage of esoteric mantras in Zen goes back to the Tang dynasty. There is evidence that Chan Buddhists adopted practices from Chinese Esoteric Buddhism in findings from Dunhuang. According to Henrik S\u00f8rensen, several successors of Shenxiu (such as Jingxian and Yixing) were also students of the Zhenyan (Mantra) school. Influential esoteric dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b, such as the U\u1e63\u1e47\u012b\u1e63a Vijaya Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b S\u016btra and the N\u012blaka\u1e47\u1e6dha Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b, also begin to be cited in the literature of the Baotang school during the Tang dynasty. Many mantras have been preserved since the Tang period and continue to be practiced in modern Chan monasteries. One common example is the \u015a\u016bra\u1e45gama Mantra,which has been heavily propagated by various prominent Chan monks, such as Venerable Hsuan Hua who founded the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas. Another example of esoteric rituals practiced by the Chan school is the Mengshan Rite for Feeding Hungry Ghosts, which is practiced by both monks and laypeople during the Hungry Ghost Festival. Chan repentance rituals, such as the Liberation Rite of Water and Land, also involve various esoteric aspects, including the invocation of esoteric deities such as the Five Wisdom Buddhas and the Ten Wisdom Kings.There is documentation that monks living at Shaolin temple during the eighth century performed esoteric practices there such as mantra and dharani, and that these also influenced Korean Seon Buddhism. During the Joseon dynasty, the Seon school was not only the dominant tradition in Korea, but it was also highly inclusive and ecumenical in its doctrine and practices, and this included Esoteric Buddhist lore and rituals (that appear in Seon literature from the 15th century onwards). According to S\u00f8rensen, the writings of several Seon masters (such as Hyujeong) reveal they were esoteric adepts.In Japanese Zen, the use of esoteric practices within Zen is sometimes termed \"mixed Zen\" (kensh\u016b zen \u517c\u4fee\u79aa), and the figure of Keizan J\u014dkin (1264\u20131325) is seen as introducing this into the Soto school. The Japanese founder of the Rinzai school, My\u014dan Eisai (1141\u20131215) was also a well known practitioner of esoteric Buddhism and wrote various works on the subject.According to William Bodiford, a very common dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b in Japanese Zen is the \u015a\u016bra\u1e45gama spell (Ry\u014dgon shu \u695e\u56b4\u546a; T. 944A), which is repeatedly chanted during summer training retreats as well as at \"every important monastic ceremony throughout the year\" in Zen monasteries. Some Zen temples also perform esoteric rituals, such as the homa ritual, which is performed at the Soto temple of Eigen-ji (in Saitama prefecture). As Bodiford writes, \"perhaps the most notable examples of this phenomenon is the ambrosia gate (kanro mon \u7518\u9732\u9580) ritual performed at every S\u014dt\u014d Zen temple\", which is associated feeding hungry ghosts, ancestor memorial rites and the ghost festival. Bodiford also notes that formal Zen rituals of Dharma transmission often involve esoteric initiations.\n\n\n== Doctrine ==\n\nZen teachings can be likened to \"the finger pointing at the moon\". Zen teachings point to the moon, awakening, \"a realization of the unimpeded interpenetration of the dharmadhatu\". But the Zen-tradition also warns against taking its teachings, the pointing finger, to be this insight itself.\n\n\n=== Buddhist Mahayana influences ===\nThough Zen-narrative states that it is a \"special transmission outside scriptures\", which \"did not stand upon words\", Zen does have a rich doctrinal background that is firmly grounded in the Buddhist tradition. It was thoroughly influenced by Mahayana teachings on the bodhisattva path, Chinese Madhyamaka (S\u0101nl\u00f9n), Yogacara (W\u00e9ish\u00ed), Praj\u00f1aparamita, the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra, and other Buddha nature texts. The influence of Madhyamaka and Praj\u00f1aparamita can be discerned in the stress on non-conceptual wisdom (praj\u00f1a) and the apophatic language of Zen literature.The philosophy of the Huayan school also had an influence on Chinese Chan. One example is the Huayan doctrine of the interpenetration of phenomena, which also makes use of native Chinese philosophical concepts such as principle (li) and phenomena (shi). The Huayan theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu also influenced the Five Ranks of Dongshan Liangjie (806\u2013869), the founder of the Caodong Chan lineage.\n\n\n=== Buddha-nature and subitism ===\nCentral in the doctrinal development of Chan Buddhism was the notion of Buddha-nature, the idea that the awakened mind of a Buddha is already present in each sentient being (pen chueh in Chinese Buddhism, hongaku in Japanese Zen). This Buddha-nature was initially equated with the nature of mind, while later Chan-teachings evaded any reification by rejecting any positivist terminology. The idea of the immanent character of the Buddha-nature took shape in a characteristic emphasis on direct insight into, and expression of this Buddha-nature. It led to a reinterpretation and Sinification of Indian meditation terminology, and an emphasis on subitism, the idea that the Buddhist teachings and practices are comprehended and expressed \"sudden,\" c.q. \"in one glance,\" \"uncovered all together,\" or \"together, completely, simultaneously,\" in contrast to gradualism, \"successively or being uncovered one after the other.\" The emphasis on subitism led to the idea that \"enlightenment occurs in a single transformation that is both total and instantaneous\" (Ch. shih-chueh).While the attribution of gradualism, attributed by Shenhui to a concurring faction, was a rhetoric device, it led to a conceptual dominance in the Chan-tradition of subitism, in which any charge of gradualism was to be avoided. This \"rhetorical purity\" was hard to reconcile conceptually with the actual practice of meditation, and left little place in Zen texts for the description of actual meditation practices, apparently rejecting any form of practice. Instead, those texts directly pointed to and expressed this awakened nature, giving way to the paradoxically nature of encounter dialogue and koans.\n\n\n=== Caodong/S\u014dt\u014d/T\u00e0o \u0110\u1ed9ng ===\n\nS\u014dt\u014d is the Japanese line of the Chinese Caodong school, which was founded during the Tang Dynasty by Dongshan Liangjie. The S\u014dt\u014d-school has de-emphasized k\u014dans since Gent\u014d Sokuch\u016b (circa 1800), and instead emphasized on shikantaza. Dogen, the founder of Soto in Japan, emphasized that practice and awakening cannot be separated. By practicing shikantaza, attainment and Buddhahood are already being expressed. For Dogen, zazen, or shikantaza, is the essence of Buddhist practice. Gradual cultivation was also recognized by Dongshan Liangjie.A lineage also exists in Vietnam, founded by 17th-century Chan master Th\u00f4ng Gi\u00e1c \u0110\u1ea1o Nam. In Vietnamese, the school is known as \"T\u00e0o \u0110\u1ed9ng.\"\n\n\n=== Linji/Rinzai ===\n\nThe Rinzai school is the Japanese lineage of the Chinese Linji school, which was founded during the Tang dynasty by Linji Yixuan. The Rinzai school emphasizes kensho, insight into one's true nature. This is followed by so-called post-satori practice, further practice to attain Buddhahood.Other Zen-teachers have also expressed sudden insight followed by gradual cultivation. Jinul, a 12th-century Korean Seon master, followed Zongmi, and also emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full buddhahood. This is also the standpoint of the contemporary Sanbo Kyodan, according to whom kensh\u014d is at the start of the path to full enlightenment.To attain this primary insight and to deepen it, zazen and k\u014dan-study is deemed essential. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by Linji in his Three Mysterious Gates and Hakuin Ekaku's Four Ways of Knowing. Another example of depiction of stages on the path are the Ten Bulls, which detail the steps on the path.\n\n\n== Scripture ==\n\n\n=== The role of the scripture ===\nContrary to the popular image, literature does play a role in the Zen training. Zen is deeply rooted in the teachings and doctrines of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. Classic Zen texts, such as the Platform sutra, contain numerous references to Buddhist canonical sutras. Unsui (Zen-monks), \"are expected to become familiar with the classics of the Zen canon\". A review of the early historical documents and literature of early Zen masters clearly reveals that they were well versed in numerous Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras, as well as Mahayana Buddhist philosophy such as Madhyamaka.Nevertheless, Zen is often pictured as anti-intellectual. This picture of Zen emerged during the Song Dynasty (960\u20131297), when Ch\u00e1n became the dominant form of Buddhism in China, and gained great popularity among the educated and literary classes of Chinese society. The use of koans, which are highly stylized literary texts, reflects this popularity among the higher classes. The famous saying \"do not establish words and letters\", attributed in this period to Bodhidharma,\n...was taken not as a denial of the recorded words of the Buddha or the doctrinal elaborations by learned monks, but as a warning to those who had become confused about the relationship between Buddhist teaching as a guide to the truth and mistook it for the truth itself.\nWhat the Zen tradition emphasizes is that the enlightenment of the Buddha came not through conceptualization but rather through direct insight. But direct insight has to be supported by study and understanding (hori) of the Buddhist teachings and texts. Intellectual understanding without practice is called yako-zen, \"wild fox Zen\", but \"one who has only experience without intellectual understanding is a zen temma, 'Zen devil'\".\n\n\n=== Grounding Ch\u00e1n in scripture ===\nThe early Buddhist schools in China were each based on a specific sutra. At the beginning of the Tang Dynasty, by the time of the Fifth Patriarch Hongren (601\u2013674), the Zen school became established as a separate school of Buddhism. It had to develop a doctrinal tradition of its own to ascertain its position and to ground its teachings in a specific sutra. Various sutras were used for this even before the time of Hongren: the \u015ar\u012bm\u0101l\u0101dev\u012b S\u016btra (Huike), Awakening of Faith (Daoxin), the Lankavatara Sutra (East Mountain School), the Diamond Sutra (Shenhui), and the Platform Sutra. None of these sutras were decisive though, since the school drew inspiration from a variety of sources. Subsequently, the Zen tradition produced a rich corpus of written literature, which has become a part of its practice and teaching. Other influential sutras are the Vimalakirti Sutra, Avatamsaka Sutra, the Shurangama Sutra, and the Mahaparinirvana Sutra.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nThe Zen-tradition developed a rich textual tradition, based on the interpretation of the Buddhist teachings and the recorded sayings of Zen-masters. Important texts are the Platform Sutra (8th century), attributed to Huineng ; the Ch\u00e1n transmission records, teng-lu, such as The Records of the Transmission of the Lamp (Ching-te ch'uan-teng lu), compiled by Tao-y\u00fcn and published in 1004; the \"y\u00fc-l\u00fc\" genre consisting of the recorded sayings of the masters, and the encounter dialogues; the koan-collections, such as the \"Gateless Gate\" and the \"Blue Cliff Record\".\n\n\n== Organization and institutions ==\n\nReligion is not only an individual matter, but \"also a collective endeavour\". Though individual experience and the iconoclastic picture of Zen are emphasised in the Western world, the Zen-tradition is maintained and transferred by a high degree of institutionalisation and hierarchy. In Japan, modernity has led to criticism of the formal system and the commencement of lay-oriented Zen-schools such as the Sanbo Kyodan and the Ningen Zen Kyodan. How to organize the continuity of the Zen-tradition in the West, constraining charismatic authority and the derailment it may bring on the one hand, and maintaining the legitimacy and authority by limiting the number of authorized teachers on the other hand, is a challenge for the developing Zen-communities in the West.\n\n\n== Narratives ==\n\nThe Ch\u00e1n of the Tang Dynasty, especially that of Mazu and Linji with its emphasis on \"shock techniques\", in retrospect was seen as a golden age of Ch\u00e1n. It became dominant during the Song Dynasty, when Ch\u00e1n was the dominant form of Buddhism in China, due to support from the Imperial Court. This picture has gained great popularity in the West in the 20th century, especially due to the influence of D.T. Suzuki, and further popularized by Hakuun Yasutani and the Sanbo Kyodan. This picture has been challenged, and complemented, since the 1970s by modern scientific research on Zen.Modern scientific research on the history of Zen discerns three main narratives concerning Zen, its history and its teachings: Traditional Zen Narrative (TZN), Buddhist Modernism (BM), Historical and Cultural Criticism (HCC). An external narrative is Nondualism, which claims Zen to be a token of a universal nondualist essence of religions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Chinese Ch\u00e1n ===\n\nZen (Chinese: Ch\u00e1n \u79aa) Buddhism, as we know it today, is the result of a long history, with many changes and contingent factors. Each period had different types of Zen, some of which remained influential, while others vanished. The history of Ch\u00e1n in China is divided into various periods by different scholars, who generally distinguish a classical phase and a post-classical period.\nFerguson distinguishes three periods from the 5th century into the 13th century:\n\nThe Legendary period, from Bodhidharma in the late 5th century to the An Lushan Rebellion around 765 CE, in the middle of the Tang Dynasty. Little written information is left from this period. It is the time of the Six Patriarchs, including Bodhidharma and Huineng, and the legendary \"split\" between the Northern and the Southern School of Ch\u00e1n.\nThe Classical period, from the end of the An Lushan Rebellion around 765 CE to the beginning of the Song Dynasty around 950 CE. This is the time of the great masters of Ch\u00e1n, such as Mazu Daoyi and Linji Yixuan, and the creation of the y\u00fc-l\u00fc genre, the recordings of the sayings and teachings of these great masters.\nThe Literary period, from around 950 to 1250, which spans the era of the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279). In this time the gongan-collections were compiled, collections of sayings and deeds by the famous masters, appended with poetry and commentary. This genre reflects the influence of literati on the development of Ch\u00e1n. This period idealized the previous period as the \"golden age\" of Ch\u00e1n, producing the literature in which the spontaneity of the celebrated masters was portrayed.Although McRae has reservations about the division of Ch\u00e1n-history in phases or periods, he nevertheless distinguishes four phases in the history of Ch\u00e1n:\nProto-Ch\u00e1n (c. 500\u2013600) (Southern and Northern Dynasties (420 to 589) and Sui Dynasty (589\u2013618 CE)). In this phase, Ch\u00e1n developed in multiple locations in northern China. It was based on the practice of dhyana and is connected to the figures of Bodhidharma and Huike. Its principal text is the Two Entrances and Four Practices, attributed to Bodhidharma.\nEarly Ch\u00e1n (c. 600\u2013900) (Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907 CE)). In this phase Ch\u00e1n took its first clear contours. Prime figures are the fifth patriarch Daman Hongren (601\u2013674), his dharma-heir Yuquan Shenxiu (606?\u2013706), the sixth patriarch Huineng (638\u2013713), protagonist of the quintessential Platform Sutra, and Shenhui (670\u2013762), whose propaganda elevated Huineng to the status of sixth patriarch. Prime factions are the Northern School, Southern School and Oxhead school.\nMiddle Ch\u00e1n (c. 750\u20131000) (from An Lushan Rebellion (755\u2013763) till Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907\u2013960/979)). In this phase developed the well-known Ch\u00e1n of the iconoclastic zen-masters. Prime figures are Mazu Daoyi (709\u2013788), Shitou Xiqian (710\u2013790), Linji Yixuan (died 867), and Xuefeng Yicun (822\u2013908). Prime factions are the Hongzhou school and the Hubei faction An important text is the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall (952), which gives a great amount of \"encounter-stories\", and the well-known genealogy of the Ch\u00e1n-school.\nSong Dynasty Ch\u00e1n (c. 950\u20131300). In this phase Ch\u00e1n took its definitive shape including the picture of the \"golden age\" of the Ch\u00e1n of the Tang-Dynasty, and the use of koans for individual study and meditation. Prime figures are Dahui Zonggao (1089\u20131163) who introduced the Hua Tou practice and Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091\u20131157) who emphasized Shikantaza. Prime factions are the Linji school and the Caodong school. The classic koan-collections, such as the Blue Cliff Record were assembled in this period, which reflect the influence of the \"literati\" on the development of Ch\u00e1n. In this phase Ch\u00e1n is transported to Japan, and exerts a great influence on Korean Seon via Jinul.\nNeither Ferguson nor McRae give a periodisation for Chinese Ch\u00e1n following the Song-dynasty, though McRae mentions \"at least a post-classical phase or perhaps multiple phases\". According to David McMahan: During the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) and the Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131912) Ch\u00e1n was part of a larger, syncretic Buddhist culture. A final phase can be distinguished from the 19th century onward, when western imperialism had a growing influence in South-East Asia, including China. A side effect of this imperial influence was the modernisation of Asian religions, adapting them to western ideas and rhetorical strategies. \n\n\n==== Origins ====\n\nBefore the arrival of the \"founder\" of Chan, Bodhidharma, various Buddhist masters of meditation or dhyana (i.e. Chan) had taught in China. These figures also brought with them various meditation texts, called the Dhy\u0101na sutras (Chinese: \u79aa\u7d93 chan jing). These early meditation works mainly drew from the teachings of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school of Kashmir. These texts include the translations of the Parthian An Shigao (147\u2013168 CE) like the Anban shouyi jing (Sanskrit: \u0100n\u0101p\u0101nasm\u1e5bti-s\u016btra), the numerous translations of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva (334\u2013413 CE, such as the Zuochan sanmei jing (Sutra of Sitting Dhy\u0101na sam\u0101dhi) and those of Buddhabhadra (like the Damoduoluo chan jing, Dharmatr\u0101ta Dhy\u0101na s\u016btra). These early meditation texts laid the groundwork for the practices of Chan Buddhism (Zen) and the works of the Tiantai meditation master Zhiyi.The translation work of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva (especially his Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 translations and his Vimalakirti Sutra),  Buddhabhadra (Avatamsaka Sutra) and Gunabhadra (Lank\u0101vat\u0101ra s\u016btra) were also key formative influences on the origins of Chan. These Buddhist texts are some of the key sources for later Chan masters. Indeed, in some early Chan texts (like the Masters of the Lank\u0101vat\u0101ra), it is Gunabhadra, not Bodhidharma, which is seen as the first patriarch who transmits the Chan lineage (here seen as synonymous with the Lank\u0101vat\u0101ra tradition) from India. The meditation works of the fourth Tiantai patriarch Zhiyi, such as his monumental Mohezhiguan, were also important sources on later Chan meditation manuals, like the Tso-chan-i.A further possible influence on the origin of Chan Buddhism is Taoism. Some of the earliest Chinese Buddhists were influenced by Daoist thought and terminology and this has led some scholars to see a Taoist influence on Chan. In his history of Zen, Heinrich Dumoulin argued that Chan Buddhist developed out of the confluence of Indian Mahayana and Chinese Taoism. Two Chinese disciples of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva, Sengzhao and Tao Sheng were influenced by Taoist works like the Laozi and Zhuangzi. These Sanlun figures in turn had an influence on some early Chan masters.\n\n\n==== Proto-Ch\u00e1n ====\n\nProto-Ch\u00e1n (c. 500\u2013600) encompasses the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420 to 589) and Sui Dynasty (589\u2013618 CE). In this phase, Ch\u00e1n developed in multiple locations in northern China. It was based on the practice of dhyana and is connected to the figures of Bodhidharma, Seng-fu and Huike, though there is little actual historical information about these early figures and most legendary stories about their life come from later, mostly Tang sources. What is known is that they were considered Mahayana meditation masters.An important text from this period is the Two Entrances and Four Practices, found in Dunhuang, and attributed to Bodhidharma. Later sources mention that these figures taught using the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra though there is no direct evidence of this from the earliest sources. According to John McRae, the earliest Chan sources on these masters show considerable influence from Madhyamaka thought, while the influence from the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra is actually much less pronounced and it is questionable if it was there at all with regards to the earliest figures like Bodhidharma and Huike.\n\n\n==== Early Ch\u00e1n ====\n\nEarly Ch\u00e1n refers to early Tang Dynasty (618\u2013750) Ch\u00e1n. The fifth patriarch Daman Hongren (601\u2013674), and his dharma-heir Yuquan Shenxiu (606?\u2013706) were influential in founding the first Chan institution in Chinese history, known as the \"East Mountain school\" (Dongshan famen). Hongren taught the practice of shou-hsin, \"maintaining (guarding) the mind,\" in which \"an awareness of True Mind or Buddha-nature within\" is maintained, \"[exhorting] the practitioners to\nunremittingly apply themselves to the practice of meditation.\"Shenxiu was the most influential and charismatic student of Hongren, he was even invited to the Imperial Court by Empress Wu. Shenxiu also became the target of much criticism by Shenhui (670\u2013762), for his \"gradualist\" teachings. Shenhui instead promoted the \"sudden\" teachings of his teacher Huineng (638\u2013713) as well as what later became a very influential Ch\u00e1n classic called the Platform Sutra. Shenhui's propaganda campaign eventually succeeded in elevating Huineng to the status of sixth patriarch of Chinese Ch\u00e1n. The sudden vs. gradual debate that developed in this era came to define later forms of Chan Buddhism.\n\n\n==== Middle Ch\u00e1n ====\n\nThe Middle Ch\u00e1n (c. 750\u20131000) period runs from the An Lushan Rebellion (755\u2013763) to the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907\u2013960/979). This phase saw the development new schools of Chan. The most important of these schools is the Hongzhou school of Mazu Daoyi (709\u2013788), to which also belong Shitou, Baizhang, and Huangbo. This school is sometimes seen as the archetypal expression of Ch\u00e1n, with its emphasis on the personal expression of insight, and its rejection of positive statements, as well as the importance it placed on spontaneous and unconventional \"questions and answers during an encounter\" (linji wenda) between master and disciple.However, modern scholars have seen much of the literature that presents these \"iconoclastic\" encounters as being later revisions during the Song era, and instead see the Hongzhou masters as not being very radical, instead promoting pretty conservative ideas, such as keeping precepts, accumulating good karma and practicing meditation. The school did produce innovative teachings and perspectives such as Mazu's views that \"this mind is Buddha\" and that \"ordinary mind is the way\", which were also critiqued by later figures, such as the influential Guifeng Zongmi (780\u2013841), for failing to differentiate between ignorance and enlightenment.By the end of the late Tang, the Hongzhou school was gradually superseded by various regional traditions, which became known as the Five Houses of Ch\u00e1n. Shitou Xiqian (710\u2013790) is regarded as the Patriarch of C\u00e1od\u00f2ng (Jp. S\u014dt\u014d) school, while Linji Yixuan (died 867) is regarded as the founder of L\u00ednj\u00ec (Jp. Rinzai) school. Both of these traditions were quite influential both in and outside of China. Another influential Ch\u00e1n master of the late Tang was Xuefeng Yicun. During the later Tang, the practice of the \"encounter dialogue\" reached its full maturity. These formal dialogues between master and disciple may have used absurd, illogical and iconoclastic language as well as non-verbal forms of communication such as the drawing of circles and physical gestures like shouting and hitting.It was also common to write fictional encounter dialogues and attribute them to previous Ch\u00e1n figures. An important text from this period is the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall (952), which gives many \"encounter-stories\", as well as establishing a genealogy of the Ch\u00e1n school. The Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution in 845 was devastating for metropolitan Chan, but the Chan school of Mazu survived, and took a leading role in the Chan of the later Tang.\n\n\n==== Song Dynasty Ch\u00e1n ====\n\nDuring Song Dynasty Ch\u00e1n (c. 950\u20131300), Ch\u00e1n Buddhism took its definitive shape, through the development of the use of koans for individual study and meditation. It was also during the Song that Chan literati developed their own idealized history of Chan, particularly promoting the idea of a Tang \"golden age\" of Chan. During the Song, Ch\u00e1n became the largest sect of Chinese Buddhism and had strong ties to the imperial government, which led to the development of a highly organized system of temple rank and administration.The dominant form of Song Ch\u00e1n was the Linji school due to support from the scholar-official class and the imperial court. This school developed the study of gong'an (\"public case\") literature, which depicted stories of master-student encounters that were seen as demonstrations of the awakened mind. Most of these stories depicted the idealized encounters of past Chan masters, particularly from the Tang era, and show the influence of the Chinese literati class. The most influential of these works are the Blue Cliff Record, the Book of Equanimity and The Gateless Gate.\nDuring the 12th century, a rivalry emerged between the Linji and the Caodong schools for the support of the scholar-official class. Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091\u20131157) of the Caodong school emphasized silent illumination or serene reflection (m\u00f2zh\u00e0o) as a means for solitary practice, which could be undertaken by lay-followers. The Linji school's Dahui Zonggao (1089\u20131163) meanwhile, introduced k'an-hua chan (\"observing the word-head\" chan), which involved meditation on the crucial phrase or \"punch line\" (hua-tou) of a gong'an.The Song also saw the syncretism of Ch\u00e1n and Pure Land Buddhism by Yongming Yanshou (904\u2013975), which would later become extremely influential. Yongming also echoed Zongmi's work in indicating that the values of Taoism and Confucianism could also be embraced and integrated into Buddhism. Ch\u00e1n also influenced Neo-Confucianism as well as certain forms of Taoism, such as the Quanzhen school.During the Song, Ch\u00e1n was also transported to Japan by figures like Eisai and exerted a great influence on Korean Seon via Jinul.\n\n\n==== Post-Classical Ch\u00e1n ====\nDuring the Ming Dynasty, the Ch\u00e1n school was so dominant that all Chinese monks were affiliated with either the Linji school or the Caodong school.Some scholars see the post-classical phase as being an \"age of syncretism.\" The post-classical period saw the increasing popularity of the dual practice of Ch\u00e1n and Pure Land Buddhism (known as nianfo Chan), as seen in the teachings of Zhongfeng Mingben (1263\u20131323) and the great reformer Hanshan Deqing (1546\u20131623). This became a widespread phenomenon and in time much of the distinction between them was lost, with many monasteries teaching both Ch\u00e1n meditation and the Pure Land practice of nianfo.The Ming dynasty also saw the efforts of figures such as Yunqi Zhuhong (1535\u20131615) and Daguan Zhenke (1543\u20131603) to revive and reconcile Chan Buddhism with the practice of Buddhist scriptural study and writing.In the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, Ch\u00e1n was \"reinvented\", by the \"revival of beating and shouting practices\" by Miyun Yuanwu (1566\u20131642), and the publication of the Wudeng yantong (\"The strict transmission of the five Chan schools\") by Feiyin Tongrong's (1593\u20131662), a dharma heir of Miyun Yuanwu. The book placed self-proclaimed Chan monks without proper Dharma transmission in the category of \"lineage unknown\" (sifa weixiang), thereby excluding several prominent Caodong monks.\n\n\n==== Modern era ====\n\nAfter further centuries of decline during the Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131912), Ch\u00e1n activity was revived again in the 19th and 20th centuries by a flurry of modernist activity. This period saw the rise of worldly Chan activism, what is sometimes called Humanistic Buddhism (or more literally \"Buddhism for human life\", rensheng fojiao), promoted by figures like Jing'an (1851\u20131912), Yuanying (1878\u20131953), Taixu (1890\u20131947), Xuyun (1840\u20131959) and Yinshun (1906\u20132005). These figures promoted social activism to address issues such as poverty and social injustice, as well as participation in political movements. They also promoted modern science and scholarship, including the use of the methods of modern critical scholarship to study the history of Chan.Many Ch\u00e1n teachers today trace their lineage back to Xuyun, including Sheng-yen and Hsuan Hua, who have propagated Ch\u00e1n in the West where it has grown steadily through the 20th and 21st centuries. Ch\u00e1n Buddhism was repressed in China during the 1960s in the Cultural Revolution, but in the subsequent reform and opening up period in the 1970s, a revival of Chinese Buddhism has been taking place on the mainland, while Buddhism has a significant following in Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as among Overseas Chinese.\n\n\n=== Spread outside of China ===\n\n\n==== Vietnamese Thi\u1ec1n ====\n\nChan was introduced to Vietnam during the early Chinese occupation periods (111 BCE to 939 CE) as Thi\u1ec1n. During the L\u00fd (1009\u20131225) and Tr\u1ea7n (1225 to 1400) dynasties, Thi\u1ec1n rose to prominence among the elites and the royal court and a new native tradition was founded, the Tr\u00fac L\u00e2m (\"Bamboo Grove\") school, which also contained Confucian and Taoist influences. In the 17th century, the Linji school was brought to Vietnam as the L\u00e2m T\u1ebf, which also mixed Chan and Pure land. L\u00e2m T\u1ebf remains the largest monastic order in the country today.Modern Vietnamese Thi\u1ec1n is influenced by Buddhist modernism. Important figures include Thi\u1ec1n master Th\u00edch Thanh T\u1eeb (1924\u2013), the activist and popularizer Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh (1926\u20132022) and the philosopher Th\u00edch Thi\u00ean-\u00c2n. Vietnamese Thi\u1ec1n is eclectic and inclusive, bringing in many practices such as breath meditation, nianfo, mantra, Theravada influences, chanting, sutra recitation and engaged Buddhism activism.\n\n\n==== Korean Seon ====\n\nSeon (\uc120) was gradually transmitted into Korea during the late Silla period (7th through 9th centuries) as Korean monks began to travel to China to learn the newly developing Chan tradition of Mazu Daoyi and returned home to establish the Chan school. They established the initial Seon schools of Korea, which were known as the \"nine mountain schools\" (\u4e5d\u5c71, gusan).\nSeon received its most significant impetus and consolidation from the Goryeo monk Jinul (1158\u20131210), who is considered the most influential figure in the formation of the mature Seon school. He founded the Jogye Order, which remains the largest Seon tradition in Korea today. Jinul founded the Songgwangsa temple as a new center of Seon study and practice. Jinul also wrote extensive works on Seon, developing a comprehensive system of thought and practice. From Dahui Zonggao, Jinul adopted the hwadu method, which remains the main meditation form taught in Seon today.\nBuddhism was mostly suppressed during the strictly Confucian Joseon Dynasty (1392\u20131910), and the number of monasteries and clergy sharply declined. The period of Japanese occupation also brought numerous modernist ideas and changes to Korean Seon. Some monks began to adopt the Japanese practice of marrying and having families, while others such as Yongseong, worked to resist the Japanese occupation. Today, the largest Seon school, the Jogye, enforces celibacy, while the second largest, the Taego Order, allows for married priests. Important modernist figures that influenced contemporary Seon include Seongcheol and Gyeongheo. Seon has also been transmitted to West, with new traditions such as the Kwan Um School of Zen.\n\n\n==== Japanese Zen ====\n\nZen was not introduced as a separate school until the 12th century, when My\u014dan Eisai traveled to China and returned to establish a Linji lineage, which eventually perished. Decades later, Nanpo Sh\u014dmy\u014d (\u5357\u6d66\u7d39\u660e) (1235\u20131308) also studied Linji teachings in China before founding the Japanese Otokan lineage, the most influential and only surviving lineage of Rinzai in Japan. In 1215, D\u014dgen, a younger contemporary of Eisai's, journeyed to China himself, where he became a disciple of the Caodong master Tiantong Rujing. After his return, D\u014dgen established the S\u014dt\u014d school, the Japanese branch of Caodong.\nThe three traditional schools of Zen in contemporary Japan are the S\u014dt\u014d (\u66f9\u6d1e), Rinzai (\u81e8\u6e08), and \u014cbaku (\u9ec3\u6a97). Of these, S\u014dt\u014d is the largest, and \u014cbaku the smallest, with Rinzai in the middle. These schools are further divided into subschools by head temple, with two head temples for S\u014dt\u014d (S\u014dji-ji and Eihei-ji, with S\u014dji-ji having a much larger network), fourteen head temples for Rinzai, and one head temple (Manpuku-ji) for \u014cbaku, for a total of 17 head temples. The Rinzai head temples, which are most numerous, have substantial overlap with the traditional Five Mountain System, and include Myoshin-ji, Nanzen-ji, Tenry\u016b-ji, Daitoku-ji, and Tofuku-ji, among others.\nBesides these traditional organizations, there are modern Zen organizations that have especially attracted Western lay followers, namely the Sanbo Kyodan and the FAS Society.\n\n\n==== Zen in the West ====\n\nAlthough it is difficult to trace the precise moment when the West first became aware of Zen as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of Soyen Shaku, a Japanese Zen monk, to Chicago during the World Parliament of Religions in 1893 is often pointed to as an event that enhanced the profile of Zen in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners other than the descendants of Asian immigrants who were pursuing a serious interest in Zen began to reach a significant level. Japanese Zen has gained the greatest popularity in the West. The various books on Zen by Reginald Horace Blyth, Alan Watts, Philip Kapleau and D. T. Suzuki published between 1950 and 1975, contributed to this growing interest in Zen in the West, as did the interest on the part of beat poets such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder. In 1958, the literary magazine Chicago Review played a significant role in introducing Zen to the American literary community when it published a special issue on Zen featuring the aforementioned beat poets and works in translation. Erich Fromm quotes D. T. Suzuki in his 1960 book Psychoanalysis and Zen Buddhism.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Buddhists\nOutline of Buddhism\nTimeline of Buddhism\nChinese Ch\u00e1n\n101 Zen Stories\nChinso\nShussan Shaka\n Katsu\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPrinted sources\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nModern popular worksD.T.

It depicts Mars and .Paak performing the song outdoors in a tropical location as several women roller-stake around them. Mars and .Paak performed the song during their concert residency An Evening with Silk Sonic at Park MGM (2022).\n\n\n== Background and production ==\nIn late February 2021, Mars and .Paak announced on social media the formation of their new band Silk Sonic and revealed the artwork for their debut studio album An Evening with Silk Sonic (2021). On March 5 that year, they released their first single \"Leave the Door Open\". The duo teased new music in the months leading up to the release of \"Skate\". After performing \"Leave the Door Open\" at the BET Awards 2021, they tempted fans with a new song, which was later revealed to be \"a hoax\". On July 28, 2021, .Paak posted a picture of a red car with the phrase \"You've Been Invited To Silk Sonic's Summertime Jam This Friday\" on Twitter, hinting at an impending release. In an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1's show New Music Daily, Mars said the track \"came about as part of thought exercise in the studio\" as he and his team were imagining they were performing a song \"in the middle of a roller rink\", and the way the bass, guitar, and drums would sound. Mars added; \"And I wanted to play congas and that's what you get. You get a song called 'Skate'. Talking about I'm trying to float. I'm trying to glide.\"On July 30, 2021, Aftermath Entertainment and Atlantic Records released \"Skate\" as the album's second single via digital download and streaming services in several countries. On the same date, Warner Music Group (WMG) also issued the track for radio airplay in Italy. American adult contemporary radio stations began adding the track to their playlists on August 2, 2021. WMG released \"Skate\" to Australian contemporary hit radio on August 6, 2021.\"Skate\" was written by Mars, Brandon Anderson, Dernst Emile II, James Fauntleroy, Domitille Degalle, and JD Beck. It was produced by Mars and D'Mile; Mars played sitar, guitar, congas, and percussion, while D'Mile sang \"background vocals, as well as playing Rhodes piano and bass guitar. .Paak played the drums and David Foreman played rhythm guitar. Larry Gold arranged and conducted the strings at Milk Boy Studios, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with co-arrangement by Steve Tirpak. The strings were recorded by Jeff Chestek, who was assisted by Cody Chicowski. Glenn Fischbach played cello; Jonathan Kim and Steve Heitlinger played viola; Blake Espy, Emma Kummrow and Gared Crawford, Natasha Colkett, Tess Varley, and Luigi Mazzocchi played violin. Charles Moniz, with engineering assistant Alex Resoagli, engineered and recorded the song at Shampoo Press & Curl Studios. Serban Ghenea mixed \"Skate\" at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, John Hanes served as the mix engineer and Bryce Bordone as mixing assistant. The song was mastered by Randy Merrill at Sterling Sound, NYC.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nMusically, \"Skate\" is a disco, funk and R&B song. The song starts as \"a high-drama anthem of stormy betrayal\" and evolves \"into a sunburst of roller-disco elation with a melody that could've owned any summer during the [President Gerald Ford] administration\". Its instrumentation includes \"rhythmic guitars, glockenspiel, Latin percussion, back-talking string section and the rising bridge\" with a late '70's sound, as well as congas. \"Skate\" is described as a \"horny track\", due to its lyrics; .Paak sings at one point; \"If being fine was a crime, girl, they'd lock your lil' fine ass up in a tower\".\"Skate\" was composed in the key of D minor with a tempo of 112 beats per minute. The singers' vocal ranges span from the a low note of D4 to a high note of F6. .Paak \"coos, booty-struck\", on the later verses. On the bridge, Mars croons, while .Paak \"opens up to the love interest\" with a \"raspy delivery\". Silk Sonic shows \"vintage vocal exhortations\". The song's lyrics discuss roller skating, and are an invitation for young women to a dance floor.\"Skate\" has been described as a \"silky-smooth jam\" and a \"groovy\". Daniel Peters from NME described the track as \"smooth and blissed\" with Mars' and .Paak's vocals \"harmonising on its upbeat refrain\". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard called the song an \"uptempo, beach-ready single\". Lars Brandle, also writing for Billboard, said \"Skate\" has a \"funky throwback '70s vibe\". In a similar view, Scott Croker of Idolator said Silk Sonic issued \"another dose of '70s nostalgia\", describing the track as \"a funky smooth tune\". Clash's Robin Murray said the single was inspired by 1970s soul-funk and shares \"a blissful, sunshine feel, tapping into that uplifting West Coast feeling\". Charu Shina of Vulture also said the track was inspired by 1970s music and called it a \"kind of smooth, funky summer jam\". Consequence's staff and Mary Siroky described \"Skate\" as a \"flashy, '70s jam\" and an \"euphoric groove with an absolutely unstoppable string section\".Lipshutz compared \"Skate\" to Mars's 2013 track \"Treasure\". Variety's Jem Aswad compared its sound to the \"disco-era acts like Tavares and mid-tempo tracks from the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack [(1977)]\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said the song is a tentative of \"recreating the sounds and structures of the era when 1970s soul melted into disco\". Similarly, Sophie Caraan from Hypebeast said the duo take \"structural cues from the smooth tunes of the '70s, adding layers of their harmonic vocals to pay homage\" to the decade. Hot Press's Pat Carty said \"Skate\" sounds like a track produced by Gamble and Huff that could have been \"included on a Car Wash sequel soundtrack\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Skate\" was met with acclaim from music critics. Variety's Aswad said the song continues to show Silk Sonic's \"loving tribute to the mid-1970s\", calling it a \"pitch-perfect throwback\". Althea Legaspi of Rolling Stone said Mars and .Paak delivered with their promise of a \"Summertime Jam\" and noted the song's \"buoyant, sunny vibes\". Croker from Idolator dubbed \"Skate\" \"\"the perfect follow-up\" to\" 'Leave The Door Open'\", and said listeners will have the song \"on repeat on [their] Spotify\". Vibe's Datwon Thomas said the duo \"serve up another dance floor scorcher ... with that same \"\"sing-a-long feel\" of\" of 'Leave The Door Open' \", ultimately calling the track \"stellar\". Sabrina Park from Harper's Bazaar said \"Skate\" could \"be our next favorite summer anthem\", calling it a \"certified bop\".Gabrielle Pierre, writing for NPR, praised Silk Sonic for their ability to \"authentically reproduce sounds of Motown for today's contemporary audience, coupling modern melodies with classic retro rhythms and reverting to revered melodies, technique and instrumentation\". Under the Radar's Mark Refern called the song an \"irresistible slice of smooth retro soul\". Shina of Vulture also said the song \"holds up to repeated listening\". Hypebeast writer Caraan opined the track was \"one of the most infectious musical offerings of the year\". Joe Walker, for HipHopDX, dubbed the song \"infectious\". Stereogum's staff praised the \"effortless\" song, saying that despite not bringing anything new, it is \"pure early-disco cosplay\" and \"an irresistible late-summer shimmer\".When reviewing the album, Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone called \"Skate\" the \"best song on the record\". In a similar review, Variety's Aswad dubbed \"Skate\" a \"rollerena anthem\" and drew attention to the \"priceless\" verses such as \"In a room full of dimes, you'd be a hundred dollars\" and \"You smell better than a barbecue\". NME's Sophie Williams wrote; \"there are gorgeously subtle flourishes throughout\" the album that are evident on \"the crisp, pristine blasts of percussion that uplift...'Skate'.\" Candace McDuffie, for Paste, said the song's sound \"could have easily felt tired and redundant\", but added there is \"enough feel-good percussion and cheesy one-liners directed at a love interest to glisten and shine\". Joe Rivers of No Ripcord said \"Skate\" is the disco song \"you've heard a million times before, \"but gains due to its \"sheer enthusiasm\". Rivers added Mars's \"charm\" makes his line \"You smell better than a barbecue\" \"sound like a sincere compliment\". Sputnikmusic's Sowing praised the track, calling it \"adorable\" and \"entertaining\" while noting its romantic theme. Sowing also said the song includes \"a slippery synth line\" and humorous verses as it compares \"the emotional space between the narrator and his partner to skaters drifting apart\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nSiroky and the staff of Consequence considered \"Skate\" the Top Song of the Week on July 30, 2021, saying the single \"is the perfect late season bop, all the joyful energy of a cookout, rooftop party, or (naturally) a long skate session under palm trees\". Stereogum's staff placed \"Skate\" among \"The 5 Best Songs of the Week\" on August 6, 2021, describing it as \"deliriously sunny and specific Philly soul homage\". The song was also included on Under the Radar's Songs of the Week on July 30, 2021; Redfern said, \"It's incredibly cheesy ... but it's also hard to argue with such a joyous song.\"\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Skate\" debuted at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100 with 13,000 downloads, 13.4 million streams, and 6.9 million radio impressions on its first tracking week. The song peaked at number 16 on the Adult Top 40 and peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It peaked at number 18 on the Mainstream Top 40 and 15 on the Rhythmic chart. The song debuted at number 11 on the US Rolling Stone Top 100. \"Skate\" entered and peaked at number 19 on the Canadian Hot 100 on the week of August 11, 2021.

The video is a \"vintage visual\" depicting Mars and .Paak playing drums that are backed by a band in an impromptu street party at a tropical outdoor location. At the same time, young women in shorts roller-skate around them. Cierra Ch\u00e9rie, one of the roller-skaters in the music video, did not know who the video they were filming was for until the day of the shoot. She said; \u201cI learned a new level of excellence from Bruno Mars and Andy as well as some of the other roller skaters ... they were on the whole time ... they were ready to perform, they were high energy\".Variety's Aswad said the music video is \"pitch-perfect\" and \"a carefree welcome tonic in a tough time\". Thomas from Vibe said the video has a \"high energy appeal\". Legaspi from Rolling Stone called it \"nostalgic, feel-good\". Walker from HipHopDX also described the video as \"feel-good\". Writing for American Songwriter, Tina Benitez-Eves wrote the \"vintage visuals fit the blissed-out funk and soul of Silk Sonic\". USA Today's Jenna Ryu said the music video shows the \"'70s feel-good nostalgia\" so people \"feel as if they're gliding, slipping and sliding into the summer\". Park from Harper's Bazaar said the video takes viewers \"into summer with its warm and inviting hues, harboring the familiar feel-good disco-R&B nostalgia with its '70s-inspired fashion and cinematographic moments\".\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of An Evening with Silk Sonic.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The song was awarded gold certifications in Australia, Italy, New Zealand and the United States while also receiving a silver certification in the United Kingdom.\nThe music video for \"We're Good\" was directed by Vania Heymann and Gal Muggia and filmed in New York City. Set on the Titanic and filmed from a lobster's point of view, it sees Lipa performing in a restaurant on the ship as the lobster watches his friends being taken out of their tank to eventually be cooked and served as dinner to the upper-class passengers Lipa performs for. Several critics complimented the video's fashion, which is taken from The Great Gatsby (2013), as well as the surreality of it. The song was further promoted with a remix by Dillon Francis and a performance by Lipa on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\n\"We're Good\" was written by Dua Lipa alongside Emily Warren, Scott Harris and its producer Sly. It was written towards the end of the sessions for Future Nostalgia. Lipa decided to leave the song off the record as she thought that all the songs needed to fit the \"future\" and \"nostalgic\" themes. She also thought that although it fit into the pop sensibilities of the Future Nostalgia material, it was not ready to be heard. Additionally, the song was unfinished at the time of the album's release and Lipa was still working on it. The singer also realized that she needed to save some music for the album's deluxe reissue. Lipa took a leap of faith with the production but thought that it perfectly fits the song's meaning. \"We're Good\" was recorded at Sly Studio in Copenhagen and Westlake Studios in Los Angeles with the vocals being recorded at TaP Studio in London. Josh Gudwin mixed the song at Henson Studios in Hollywood while Chris Gehringer mastered it at Sterling Sound in Edgewater, New Jersey.Musically, \"We're Good\" is a midtempo tropical-pop song. The song was noted for being a departure from the disco-orientated music of Future Nostalgia, incorporating elements of trap and reggae rock while using stylizations from bossa nova and early 2000s music. The song has a length of 2:45 and is constructed in verse\u2013chorus form. It is composed in the time signature of 44 time in the key of F\u266f Major, with a tempo of 134 beats per minute. The song follows a chord progression of G\u266fm\u2013C\u266f in the verses while additional F\u266f and B chords are added in the bridges; the chorus follows a B\u2013C\u266f\u2013F\u266f\u2013G\u266fm sequence. The song uses a tropical trap production that features strummed parts, laid-back, midtempo instrumentals, a gentle groove, and a rolling trap beat.Lipa uses seductive vocals that range from G\u266f3 to B4 and makes use of belts and cracks. Lyrically, \"We're Good\" is a breakup anthem where Lipa sings about an amicable split from a former boyfriend. She fantasizes about this way to end a relationship, and showcases a theme of one freeing themselves from being trapped in a relationship that is not meant to be. She sings mainly about one's solo recovery from a relationship that has run its course, showing the savage side of a breakup and a cold hearted attitude to moving on. She mentions how in this sort of breakup, the two parties would not get mad when the other moves on. The singer explained that she thought that this type of this split gets lost in translation a lot of the time and when things are ego-driven, it's over. The opening line \"I'm on an island\" was speculated to be a response to the backlash she faced while vacationing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The song also includes a metaphor of \"sleeping and cocaine\" to show the incompatibility of a relationship. Lipa stretches the lyric \"cocaine\" over multiple syllables, one of the first times this has been done by a mainstream act.\nThe whole story behind the song is an amicable breakup. I think a lot of people wish and hope for those, especially because they can be such a difficult process to go through that at some point, you just hope that it's a very easy break and you can both just move on with your life.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nFollowing the March 2020 release of Future Nostalgia, Lipa revealed that a deluxe reissue of the album would be released, later announcing its 2021 release date. In November 2020, she revealed that its lead single would be released in early 2021 and began teasing its release that year. On 3 February 2021, Lipa formally announced the song title and release date as well as revealing the cover art. \"We're Good\" was released for digital download and streaming through Warner Records on 11 February 2021 and was simultaneously released as the thirteenth track on Future Nostalgia: The Moonlight Edition, the album's deluxe reissue. Lipa admitted that she was nervous about releasing the song as it was sonically very risky and an uncategorized genre, however, she thought the content was what made the song really interesting.On 12 February 2021, the song was released for radio airplay in Italy. In the United States, the song was serviced to contemporary hit radio formats on 16 February as well as adult contemporary radio formats on 1 March 2021. On 12 March 2021, a remix of \"We're Good\" by Dillon Francis was released alongside its radio edit and extended version. It is a synth-led deep house song with rhythmic elements. Set to a tech house beat, it features uplifting piano rhythms and Lipa's vocals chopped, while the DJ builds up the production layer by layer before dropping it into a gritty arrangement. Lipa performed \"We're Good\" for the first time on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge on 19 April 2021.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nJason Lipshutz of Billboard said \"We're Good\" takes a little while to \"fully detonate\", but praised Lipa's performance, pointing out how she \"tackles every lyric with such passion and precision\". The staff of the same magazine viewed the song as \"sultry\" while Chris Murphy of Vulture thought that the opening line was a \"bold\" choice. Robin Murray of Clash viewed the song as \"a bubbling piece of future-facing pop\" that shows the singer \"in her element\", while also stating that the opening line is \"a little provocative\". In The Wall Street Journal, Natalia Barr hypothesized that the laid-back instrumentals implied that an amicable breakup is \"as dreamy as a seaside vacation\". For The New York Times, Lindsay Zoladz thought that the song sees Lipa at her \"cheekiest\" and that it is \"pretty straightforward and fun\". She went on to describe the song as \"buoyant\" and \"a sassy, slinky kiss-off\". In The Guardian, Mark Beaumont named the song a \"sumptuous slice of pop tropic\u00e1lia\" while theorizing that Lipa rejected several metaphors she could have used in the lyrics.For Paper, Shaad D'Souza theorized that Lipa took inspiration from her 2020 collaboration with Miley Cyrus, \"Prisoner\", for \"We're Good\" with the \"vintage, rock-inflected pop\" sound. He additionally praised it for being \"simmering and brilliant, constantly switching gears until its end\". Stereogum's Chris DeVille thought the song was \"interesting\" to see Lipa depart the disco sound of Future Nostalgia, but compared the song's sound to that of \"Rude\" (2013) by Magic!. Audacy's Maia Kedem compared the song's chorus to the works of No Doubt. Notion's staff saw it as an \"earworm single\". The staff of DIY viewed the song as a \"sizzling\" song and editor Emma Swann dubbed it \"undeniably a bop of the highest order, a gut-punch of pure pop\". Hal Kitchen of 25YearsLaterSite thought it is Lipa's \"first dud single\", blaming the \"tacky, shrink-wrapped island vibe\" as well as the \"incredibly stiff and cheap-sounding production\". However, he praised Lipa's vocal performance as well as the songwriting.For Uproxx, Derrick Rossignol perceived that although \"We're Good\" moved away from its parent album's sound, it is \"just as fun\". Caitlin White of the same website said that the song \"builds on everything she established\" on Future Nostalgia and noted that it takes the album into \"groovier realms\". The staff of The Singles Jukebox gave the song a 4.31 score. Many thought that the song's midtempo sound was did not fit Lipa compared to her previous releases, while also commenting that the sleeping and cocaine metaphor did not make sense. Additionally, they drew comparisons from the song to \"Doin' Time\" (2019) by Lana Del Rey, the works of the Magnetic Fields, \"Thank U, Next\" (2018) by Ariana Grande and \"Harleys in Hawaii\" (2019) by Katy Perry. Some also thought that \"If It Ain't Me\" and \"That Kind of Woman\" would have made better singles for Future Nostalgia: The Moonlight Edition.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"We're Good\" debuted and peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Global 200 chart and reached number 16 on Billboard's Euro Digital Song Sales chart. In February 2021, the song debuted at its peak of number 25 on the UK Singles Chart, with first-week sales of 13,763 units. It spent 14 weeks on the chart.

The song reached the summit of the Mexico Airplay chart.\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\n\n=== Production and release ===\nThe music video for \"We're Good\" was directed by Israeli directing duo, Vania Heymann and Gal Muggia. As the song is quite different from other tracks on Future Nostalgia, Lipa wanted to get the album's modern and nostalgic themes into the video, whether that was with the video itself, the fashion or some other aspect. Heymann and Muggia came to Lipa with the video's treatment. Lipa found the concept of a love story between lobsters interesting. She was also unaware that lobsters could convey that much emotion. Lipa thought it would be cool to counteract the song's breakup themes with a love story video. The video was filmed in New York City in December 2020. Custom built sets and green screens were used for filming. The parts where the boat floods were filmed using smaller replicas of the sets with actual water flowing through. Some of the lobster's parts were animated. Lipa stated that for this video, she had to get into a character. She also explained that the lobster was really the main character and she was a supporting actress. The music video for \"We're Good\" premiered on 12 February 2021 via the weekly YouTube series, Released, where Lipa was a guest.\n\n\n=== Analysis and synopsis ===\n\nThe music video for \"We're Good\" is from the perspective of a lobster on the Titanic. All the gowns Lipa wears are taken from the 2013 film The Great Gatsby, however, they all have an updated look to mirror Future Nostalgia's theme of merging \"future\" with \"nostalgia\". The visual opens with a view of The Abduction of Europa, a painting by No\u00ebl-Nicolas Coypel. The painting predicts the future of the passengers as they will soon experience the sinking of the Titanic. It then goes to a 1920s-styled restaurant where Lipa appears as a singer entertaining the upper-class guests of the ship. She is accompanied by a violinist, a double bassist and a pianist. The singer wears a vintage Prada gown covered in crystals with white silk gloves, oversized vintage jewelry and a pair of Marc Jacobs platform boots.Lipa dances on a small stage while also sitting with the pianist on his bench. The video balances between shots of Lipa performing and shots of a group of lobsters in a tank. The lobsters have the claws tied together by bows as one main one watches in horror as their friends begin being taken out of the tank to be cooked in a boiling pot. The lobsters are then cooked and served to the passengers. The Abduction of Europa painting is later shown again during a brief intermission, before Lipa returns to the stage accompanied by two background dancers who wear beaded gowns with crystals, green sequins and luscious silks. The singer switches outfits into another Prada gown with a billowing skirt alongside a Faberg\u00e9 necklace, emerald earrings, rings and bracelets. Lobsters continue to be taken to be cooked and served to the passengers as Lipa continues to perform. Lipa changes into a third outfit, a sequined, vintage Miu Miu gown with green silk gloves and her hair in a vampy up-do. Lipa's makeup consists of bronze eyeshadow with a gold shimmer alongside mascara, subtle midnight blue eyeliner and a russet shade lipstick on her slightly over-lined lips.The final main lobster eventually gets chosen to be cooked. The cook brings it to the kitchen before realizing a pipe on the boat had malfunctioned, making it impossible for the lobster to be cooked. The lobster eventually gets thrown back into the tank before the restaurant is closed and everyone leaves. The ship then begins to sink, with the tables crashing against a wall, and water crashing through the restaurant and the ship's corridors. The lobster crashes through with the water, and eventually makes its way out and back into the sea. The camera then pans up to a frozen-breathed Lipa singing the song's final lines from a lifeboat as the image of the Titanic sinking appears in the background. The video closes with the image of the Titanic firing a flare gun as it sinks. The lobsters used in the video are a metaphor for love as lobsters mate for life, while the boat sinking mirrors the song's themes of feeling trapped in a relationship and setting love free. The sinking sees Lipa and the lobster both being thrown back into the sea, a metaphor to show that both will find new partners to start the relationship process over again.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nMurphy thought it was a bold choice for Lipa to include the lobster allegory and the Titanic sinking in the video. For Billboard, Rania Aniftos called the video \"stunning\" and \"surreal\". Zoladz said that the video is \"full of irreverent, not-sure-it-all-quite-lands humor\" with the lobster escaping into the ocean. Prane\u0161imas Spaudai of L'Officiel viewed the video as \"fun\" and \"surreal\" while noting that the \"playfulness\" of it is from the unexpected turn for the lobster. Kedem was confused on whether the Titanic theme was \"underlying or overlying\" but nevertheless named it \"glamorous and slightly morbid\". Murray named it \"stylish\" while Liam Hess of Vogue noted the fashion had flapper inspiration. The DIY staff viewed the video as a \"wild journey of a sad lobster\" and Swann called it \"bonkers\" and stated it gives the song \"bonus points\". Mic's Shawn Cooke said the video's retro style fits well and called it \"kooky\". Kitchen viewed the video as \"awful, wannabe quirky\" and thought it is \"the nail in the song's coffin\". In The Straits Times, Eddino Abdul Hadi noted the video's departure from Lipa's usual \"club-friendly aesthetics\" for \"1920s-inspired glamour\".\n\n\n== Track listings ==\nDigital download and streaming\"We're Good\" \u2013 2:45Digital download and streaming \u2013 Dillon Francis remix\"We're Good\" (Dillon Francis remix) \u2013 3:06Digital download and streaming \u2013 Dillon Francis remix \u2013 radio edit\"We're Good\" (Dillon Francis remix) [radio edit] \u2013 3:05Digital download and streaming \u2013 Dillon Francis remix \u2013 Beatport version\"We're Good\" (Dillon Francis remix) \u2013 3:06\n\"We're Good\" (Dillon Francis remix extended) \u2013 3:38\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDua Lipa \u2013  vocals\nSly \u2013  production, backing vocals, engineering, keyboards, live drums, programming\nEmily Warren \u2013  vocal production, backing vocals\nScott Harris \u2013  vocal production, backing vocals, guitar\nCaroline Ailin \u2013  backing vocals\nTara Siegel \u2013  backing vocals\nZach Gurka \u2013  backing vocals\nAndreas Lund \u2013  guitar\nGreg Eliason \u2013  engineering\nBrian Cruz \u2013  assistant engineer\nJosh Gudwin \u2013  mixing\nHeidi Wang \u2013  assistant mixing\nChris Gehringer \u2013  mastering\nWill Quinnell \u2013  assistant mastering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Billboard Mexico Airplay number ones\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAudio on YouTube\nBehind the scenes of the music video on YouTube\nLyrics of this song at Genius",

For his voice work in Great American Speeches (1959), Price was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.\nPrice was also an art collector and arts consultant, with a degree in art history, and he lectured and wrote books on the subject. The Vincent Price Art Museum at East Los Angeles College is named in his honor. Price was also a noted gourmet cook.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nVincent Leonard Price Jr. was born on May 27, 1911, in St. Louis, Missouri, the youngest of the four children of Vincent Leonard Price, president of the National Candy Company, and his wife Marguerite Cobb (n\u00e9e Wilcox) Price. His grandfather was Vincent Clarence Price, who invented \"Dr. Price's Baking Powder\", the first cream of tartar-based baking powder, and it secured the family's fortune. Price was of Welsh and English descent and was a descendant of Peregrine White, the first white child born in colonial Massachusetts, being born on the Mayflower while it was in Provincetown Harbor.\nPrice attended the St. Louis Country Day School and Milford Academy in Milford, Connecticut. In 1933, he graduated with a degree in English and a minor in art history from Yale University, where he worked on the campus humor magazine The Yale Record. After teaching for a year, he entered the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, intending to study for a master's degree in fine arts. Instead, he was drawn to the theater, first appearing on stage professionally in 1934. His acting career began in London in 1935, performing with Orson Welles's Mercury Theatre.In 1936, Price appeared as Prince Albert in the American production of Laurence Housman's play Victoria Regina, which starred Helen Hayes in the title role of Queen Victoria.\n\n\n== Introduction to film roles ==\n\nPrice started out in films as a character actor. He made his film debut in Service de Luxe (1938), and established himself in the film Laura (1944), opposite Gene Tierney, directed by Otto Preminger. He played Joseph Smith in the movie Brigham Young (1940) and William Gibbs McAdoo in Wilson (1944), as well as Bernadette's prosecutor, Vital Dutour, in The Song of Bernadette (1943), and as a pretentious priest in The Keys of the Kingdom (1944).\nPrice's first venture into the horror genre, for which he later became best known, was in the Boris Karloff film Tower of London (1939). The following year, Price portrayed the title character in The Invisible Man Returns (a role he reprised in a voice-only cameo in the closing scene of the horror-comedy spoof Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein released in 1948). He reunited with Tierney in Leave Her to Heaven (1945) and Dragonwyck (1946). He also had many villainous roles in film noir thrillers such as The Web (1947), The Long Night (1947), Rogues' Regiment (1948), and The Bribe (1949), with Robert Taylor, Ava Gardner, and Charles Laughton.\nPrice's first starring role was as con man James Reavis in the biopic The Baron of Arizona (1950). He did a comedic turn as the tycoon Burnbridge Waters, co-starring with Ronald Colman in Champagne for Caesar (also 1950), one of his favorite film roles.Price was active in radio, portraying the Robin Hood-inspired crime-fighter Simon Templar in The Saint, which ran from 1947 to 1951. In the 1950s, Price moved into more regular horror-film roles with the leading role in House of Wax (1953) as a homicidal sculptor, the first three-dimensional film to land in the year's top 10 at the North American box-office. His next roles were The Mad Magician (1954), the monster movie The Fly (1958), and its sequel Return of the Fly (1959). That same year, Price starred in two thrillers by producer-director William Castle: House on Haunted Hill as eccentric millionaire Fredrick Loren, and The Tingler as Dr. Warren Chapin, who discovered the titular creature. He appeared in the radio drama Three Skeleton Key, the story of an island lighthouse besieged by an army of rats. He had first performed the work in 1950 on Escape and returned to it in 1956 and 1958 for Suspense.\n\nOutside the horror realm, Price played Baka in The Ten Commandments, released in 1956. About this time, he also appeared in episodes of television shows such as Science Fiction Theatre, Playhouse 90, and General Electric Theater. In the 1955\u201356 television season, he was cast three times on the religion anthology series Crossroads. In the 1955 episode \"Cleanup\", Price portrayed the Reverend Robert Russell. In 1956, he was cast as Rabbi Gershom Mendes Seixas in \"The Rebel\", and as the Rev. Alfred W. Price in \"God's Healing\".\n\n\n== 1960s ==\nIn the 1960s, Price achieved a number of low-budget filmmaking successes with Roger Corman and American International Pictures (AIP) starting with the House of Usher (1960), which earned over $2 million at the box office in the United States and led to the subsequent Edgar Allan Poe adaptations of The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), Tales of Terror (1962), The Comedy of Terrors (1963), The Raven (1963), The Masque of the Red Death (1964), and The Tomb of Ligeia (1964). He starred in The Last Man on Earth (1964), the first adaptation of the Richard Matheson novel I Am Legend, and portrayed witch hunter Matthew Hopkins in Witchfinder General (US: The Conqueror Worm, 1968) set during the English Civil War. Price also starred in comedy films such as Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine (1965) and its sequel Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs (1966). In 1968, he played the part of an eccentric artist in the musical Darling of the Day, opposite Patricia Routledge.In the 1960s, Price began his role as a guest on the television game show Hollywood Squares, becoming a semiregular in the 1970s, including being one of the guest panelists on the finale in 1980.Price made many guest-star appearances in television shows during the decade, including The Red Skelton Show, Daniel Boone, F Troop, Get Smart, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. He had a recurring role in the Batman TV series as the villain Egghead from 1966 to 1967. In 1964, he provided the narration for the Tombstone Historama in Tombstone, Arizona, which was still in operation as of 2016. He also starred as the host of the Australian TV series If These Walls Could Speak, in which a short history of a historical building (supposedly narrated by the building itself) was covered, and as the narrating voice of the building.\n\n\n== Later career ==\nDuring the early 1970s, Price hosted and starred in BBC Radio's horror and mystery series The Price of Fear. He accepted a cameo part in the Canadian children's television program The Hilarious House of Frightenstein (1971) in Hamilton, Ontario, on the local television station CHCH-TV. In addition to the opening and closing monologues, his role in the show was to recite poems about various characters, sometimes wearing a cloak or other costumes. He appeared in The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971), its sequel Dr. Phibes Rises Again (1972), and Theatre of Blood (1973), in which he portrayed one of two serial killers. That same year, he appeared as himself in Mooch Goes to Hollywood, a film written by Jim Backus. \nPrice was an admirer of the works of Edgar Allan Poe, and in 1975 visited the Edgar Allan Poe Museum in Richmond, Virginia, where he had his picture taken with the museum's popular stuffed raven. Price also recorded dramatic readings of Poe's short stories and poems, which were collected together with readings by Basil Rathbone. \nIn 1975, Price and his wife Coral Browne appeared together in an international stage adaptation of Ard\u00e8le, which played in the U.S. and in London at the Queen's Theatre. During this run, Browne and Price starred together in the BBC Radio play Night of the Wolf first airing in 1975. Price greatly reduced his film work from around 1975, as horror itself suffered a slump, and he increased his narrative and voice work, as well as advertising Milton Bradley's Shrunken Head Apple Sculpture.Price provided a monologue for the Alice Cooper song \"Devil's Food\" on the Welcome to My Nightmare album in 1975, and he appeared in the corresponding TV special Alice Cooper: The Nightmare. He starred for a year in the early 1970s in the syndicated daily radio program Tales of the Unexplained. He made guest appearances in a 1970 episode of Here's Lucy, showcasing his art expertise, and in a 1972 episode of ABC's The Brady Bunch, in which he played a deranged archaeologist. In October 1976, he appeared as the featured guest in an episode of The Muppet Show.\n\nIn 1977, Price began performing as Oscar Wilde in the one-man stage play Diversions and Delights, written by John Gay and directed by Joe Hardy, and set in a Parisian theatre on a night about one year before Wilde's death. The original tour of the play was a success in every city except for New York City. In the summer of 1979, Price performed the role of Wilde at the Tabor Opera House in Leadville, Colorado, on the same stage from which Wilde had spoken to miners about art some 96 years before. He eventually performed the play worldwide. Victoria Price stated in her biography of her father that several members of Price's family and friends thought that this was his best acting performance.In 1979, Price starred with his wife in the short-lived CBS series Time Express. That same year he hosted the hour-long television special America Screams, riding on several roller coasters and recounting their history. During 1979\u20131980, he hosted the \"Mystery Night\" segment of the radio series Sears Radio Theater.\n\nIn 1982, Price provided the narrator's voice in Vincent, Tim Burton's six-minute film about a young boy who flashes from reality into a fantasy where he is Vincent Price. He appeared as Sir Despard Murgatroyd in a 1982 television production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore (with Keith Michell as Robin Oakapple). In 1982, Price provided the spoken-word sequence to the end of the Michael Jackson song \"Thriller\". In 1983, he played the Sinister Man in the British spoof horror film Bloodbath at the House of Death. He appeared in House of the Long Shadows with Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and John Carradine; he had worked with each of those actors at least once in previous decades, but this was the first time that all had teamed up. One of his last major roles, and one of his favorites, was as the voice of Professor Ratigan in Walt Disney Pictures' The Great Mouse Detective in 1986.From 1981 to 1989, Price hosted the PBS television series Mystery! In 1985, he provided voice talent on the Hanna-Barbera series The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo as the mysterious \"Vincent Van Ghoul\", who aided Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo, and the gang in recapturing thirteen demons. He was a lifelong fan of roller coasters, and he narrated a 1987 thirty-minute documentary on the history of roller coasters and amusement parks, including Coney Island. During this time (1985\u20131989), he appeared in horror-themed commercials for Tilex bathroom cleanser.\nIn 1984, Price appeared in Shelley Duvall's live-action series Faerie Tale Theatre as the Mirror in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", and the narrator for \"The Boy Who Left Home to Find Out About the Shivers\". In 1987, he starred with Bette Davis, Lillian Gish, and Ann Sothern in The Whales of August, a story of two sisters living in Maine facing the end of their days. His performance in The Whales of August earned the only award nomination of his career, an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male.In 1989, Price was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. His last significant film work was as the inventor in Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands (1990).In 1990, Price recorded the narration as the Phantom for Disneyland Paris's Phantom Manor. After the attraction opened in 1992, though, the narration was shortly removed and replaced with one entirely in French, performed by G\u00e9rard Chevalier. Only Price's infamous laughter remained on the soundtrack. In 2018, during Phantom Manor's major renovation, parts of Price's narration were announced to be restored to the soundtrack of the attraction. Since the 2019 reopening, the new tracks are dual-language; Price's original excerpts as well as previously unused material from his 1990 recording comprise the English-speaking portions, while actor Bernard Alane voices the Phantom in French.\n\n\n== Art ==\nPrice, who studied art history at Yale, was an art lover and collector. He was a commissioner of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board.In 1957, impressed by the spirit of the students and the community's need for the opportunity to experience original art works first hand, Vincent and Mary Grant Price donated 90 pieces from their private collection and a large amount of money to establish the Vincent Price Art Museum at East Los Angeles College in Monterey Park, California, which was the first \"teaching art collection\" owned by a community college in the United States. They ultimately donated some 2,000 pieces; the collection contains over 9,000 pieces and has been valued in excess of $5 million.Price also spent time working as an art consultant for Sears-Roebuck: From 1962 to 1971, Sears offered the \"Vincent Price Collection of Fine Art\", selling about 50,000 fine-art prints to the general public. Works which Price selected or commissioned for the collection included some by Rembrandt, Pablo Picasso, and Salvador Dal\u00ed. Public access to fine art was important to Price, who according to his daughter Victoria, saw the Sears deal as an \"opportunity to put his populist beliefs into practice, to bring art to the American public.\" In the 1960s, portraits painted by Charles Bird King, of Native Americans were secured for Jacqueline Kennedy's White House Restoration. Through the efforts of Vincent Price these five paintings were paid for and donated to the White House Collection by Sears-Roebuck.Price amassed his own extensive collection of art, and in 2008, a painting bought for $25 by a couple from Dallas was identified as a piece from Price's collection. Painted by leading Australian modernist Grace Cossington Smith, it was given a modern valuation of AU$45,000.\n\n\n== Cooking ==\nPrice was a gourmet cook, and he authored several cookbooks with his second wife, Mary. These include:\n\nA Treasury of Great Recipes (1965)\nMary and Vincent Price present a National Treasury of Cookery (1967)\nMary and Vincent Price's Come into the Kitchen Cook Book: A Collector's Treasury of America's Great Recipes (1969)\nCooking Price-Wise with Vincent Price (1971)Mary and Vincent Price present a National Treasury of Cookery was a five-volume series, packaged in a boxed set and published by the Heirloom Publishing Company. These five books were combined into a single book two years later and published as Mary and Vincent Price's Come into the Kitchen Cook Book: A Collector's Treasury of America's Great Recipes. Most of the Prices' cookbooks remained in print throughout the 1970s. After being out of print for several decades, two of their books were reprinted; A Treasury of Great Recipes (in August 2015 by Calla Editions) and Mary and Vincent Price's Come into the Kitchen Cook Book (in November 2016 by Calla Editions), both featuring new forewords by their daughter Victoria Price. Cooking Price-Wise with Vincent Price was scheduled to be reprinted by Dover Publishing in October 2017 under the updated title Cooking Price-Wise \u2013 The Original Foodie.\nIn 1971, Price hosted his own cooking program on British television, called Cooking Price-Wise produced for the ITV network by Thames Television, which was broadcast in April and May 1971. This show gave its name to Price's fourth and final cookbook later that year. Price promoted his cookbooks on many talk shows, one of the most famous instances being the November 21, 1975, broadcast of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, when he demonstrated how to poach a fish in a dishwasher.\nPrice recorded a number of audio cooking tutorials titled International Cooking Course. These were titled Bounty of Paradise, Classical Spanish Cuisine, Cuisina Italiana, Delights from the Sultan's Pantry, Dinner at the Casbah, Dining at Versailles, Exotic Delights from the Far East, Food of the Gods, Foods from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, La Cocina Mejicana, The Bard's Board, and The Wok. In addition to those, he recorded an audio wine course titled Wine Is Elegance. These audio recordings were released on 33\u2153 LPs by Nelson Industries in 1977, and were also packaged in a 12-cassette boxed set titled Beverly Hills Cookbook \u2013 Cookbook of the Rich and Famous, Your Host Mr. Vincent Price.In August 1982, he co-hosted A Taste of China for Thames Television over five episodes. He also prepared a fish recipe on Wolfgang Puck's Cooking with Wolfgang Puck VHS, released in October 1987 by Warner Home Video.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPrice married three times. His first marriage was in 1938 to former actress Edith Barrett; they had one son, poet and columnist Vincent Barrett Price. Edith and Price divorced in 1948. Price married Mary Grant in 1949, and they had a daughter, inspirational speaker Victoria Price, on April 27, 1962, naming her after Price's first major success in the play Victoria Regina. The marriage lasted until 1973. He married Australian actress Coral Browne in 1974; she had appeared as one of his victims in Theatre of Blood (1973). The marriage lasted until her death in 1991.\nVictoria Price's biography Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography (1999) details Price's early antisemitism and initial admiration for Adolf Hitler. According to his daughter: \"When he went to Germany and Austria as a young man, he was struck by a lot of things going on during the Weimar Republic and the disillusion of the empire... So when Hitler came into power, instead of seeing him as a dangerous force, he was sort of swept up in this whole idea that Hitler was going to bring German pride back.\" However, Price became a liberal after becoming friends with New York intellectuals such as Dorothy Parker and Lillian Hellman in the 1930s, so much so that he was \"greylisted\" under McCarthyism in the 1950s for having been a prewar \"premature anti-Nazi\", and after being unable to find work for a year, agreed to requests by the FBI that he sign a \"secret oath\" to save his career. Victoria said that her father became so liberal that \"one of my brother's earliest memories is when Franklin Roosevelt's death was announced, my father fell backwards off the sofa sobbing.\"Price denounced racial and religious prejudice as a form of poison at the end of an episode of The Saint, which aired on NBC Radio on July 30, 1950,\nclaiming that Americans must actively fight against it because such prejudices within the United States fuels support for the nation's enemies. He was later appointed to the Indian Arts and Crafts Board under the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration; he called the appointment \"kind of a surprise, since I am a Democrat\".Price was supportive of his daughter when she came out as a lesbian, and he was critical of Anita Bryant's anti-gay-rights campaign in the 1970s. In an interview in 2015, Victoria confirmed that her father confided with her of his intimate relationships with men when she came out to him as a lesbian.\n\n\n== Death ==\nPrice suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Parkinson's disease. His symptoms were especially severe during the filming of Edward Scissorhands, making cutting his filming schedule short a necessity. His illness also contributed to his retirement from Mystery! in 1989. He died at age 82 of lung cancer on October 25, 1993, at his home in Los Angeles, California. His remains were cremated and his ashes scattered off Point Dume in Malibu.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe A&E Network aired an episode of Biography the night following Price's death, highlighting his horror-film career, but because of its failure to clear copyrights, the show was never aired again. Four years later, A&E produced its updated episode, titled Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain, which aired on October 12, 1997. The script was by Lucy Chase Williams, author of The Complete Films of Vincent Price. In early 1991, Tim Burton was developing a personal documentary with the working title Conversations with Vincent, in which interviews with Price were shot at the Vincent Price Gallery, but the project was never completed and was eventually shelved.Rhythmeen, the ZZ Top album from 1996, includes a track named \"Vincent Price Blues\".\nPrice was an honorary board member and strong supporter of the Witch's Dungeon Classic Movie Museum in Bristol, Connecticut, until his death in 1993. The museum features detailed life-sized wax replicas of characters from some of Price's films, including The Fly, The Abominable Dr. Phibes, and The Masque of the Red Death. A black-box theater at Price's alma mater, Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, is named after him.\nTim Burton directed a short stop-motion film as a tribute to Vincent Price called Vincent, about a young boy named Vincent Malloy who is obsessed with the grim and macabre; it is narrated by Price. \"Vincent Twice, Vincent Twice\" was a parody on Sesame Street. He was parodied in an episode of The Simpsons (\"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\"). Price had his own Spitting Image puppet, who was always trying to be \"sinister\" and lure people into his ghoulish traps, only for his victims to point out all the obvious flaws.\nStarting in November 2005, featured cast member Bill Hader of the NBC sketch comedy/variety show Saturday Night Live has played Price in a recurring sketch in which Price hosts botched holiday specials filled with celebrities of the 1950s/'60s. Other cast members who played Price on SNL include Dan Aykroyd and Michael McKean (who played Price when he hosted a season-10 episode and again when he was hired as a cast member for the 1994\u201395 season).\nIn 1999, a frank and detailed biography about Price written by his daughter, Victoria, was published by St. Martin's Press. In late May 2011, an event was held by the organization Cinema St. Louis to celebrate what would have been Price's 100th birthday. It included a public event with Victoria at the Missouri History Museum and a showcase of ephemeral and historic items at the gallery inside the Sheldon Concert Hall.\nIn an unusual convergence of widely different generational and cultural backgrounds, the genteel Price was a friend of the English hard rock band Deep Purple and in 1975, he appeared on Roger Glover's live version of The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast as a narrator. Decades later, in 2013, Deep Purple released \"Vincent Price\", a single the band members dedicated to him. That same year, American director and writer John Waters composed a \"heartfelt and appreciative\" retrospective on Price for Turner Classic Movies, which recognized the actor as its \"Star of the Month\" in October 2013 and showcased then a selection of his most popular films. The tribute was repeatedly broadcast on TCM to promote and complement those televised presentations. In sharing with viewers his feelings about Price, Waters at one point describes the actor's screen appeal, especially when he was featured in his darker roles:One raise of his eyebrow and you knew you were about to be thrilled by a debonair, evil, yet sympathetic villain...I can't imagine these films without Vincent Price in them. He was just a fine actor, never pretentious. The audiences that went to see him were all-inclusive, from the poorest people to the richest. Nobody disliked him. Vincent Price was classless, even though he was classy, an exaggerated gentleman. He gave upscale a good name, and he was always handsome, dignified, charming, and a little bit sinister.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Radio appearances ==\n\n\n== Books ==\nPrice, Vincent (1959).

        "Hold On, Justin Bieber": [
            "\"Hold On\" is a song by Canadian singer Justin Bieber. It was released through Def Jam Recordings on March 5, 2021, as the fourth single from his sixth studio album, Justice. Bieber wrote the song with producers Andrew Watt and Louis Bell alongside Jon Bellion, Ali Tamposi, Gotye, and Luiz Bonf\u00e1. \"Hold On\" interpolates Gotye's 2011 single, \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", which was written by himself and Bonf\u00e1; therefore, Gotye and Bonf\u00e1 are given songwriting credits on the song. A music video starring Bieber and Christine Ko was released alongside the song. The single has reached the top ten in twelve countries worldwide and has reached number four on the Billboard Global 200 chart.",

            "\"Hold On\" is a song by Canadian singer Justin Bieber. It was released through Def Jam Recordings on March 5, 2021, as the fourth single from his sixth studio album, Justice. Bieber wrote the song with producers Andrew Watt and Louis Bell alongside Jon Bellion, Ali Tamposi, Gotye, and Luiz Bonf\u00e1. \"Hold On\" interpolates Gotye's 2011 single, \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", which was written by himself and Bonf\u00e1; therefore, Gotye and Bonf\u00e1 are given songwriting credits on the song. A music video starring Bieber and Christine Ko was released alongside the song. The single has reached the top ten in twelve countries worldwide and has reached number four on the Billboard Global 200 chart.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nJustin Bieber released the singles \"Holy\" and \"Lonely\" in 2020, followed by \"Anyone\" in January 2021. He announced his sixth studio album, Justice, the following month. Its track \"Hold On\" was written by Bieber, Ali Tamposi, Jon Bellion, and producers Andrew Watt and Louis Bell. The song interpolates \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" (2011), written by Walter De Backer and Luiz Bonf\u00e1, who thus receive official songwriting credits.Def Jam Recordings released \"Hold On\" as a single for digital download and streaming in various countries on March 5, 2021. The same day, Universal Music Group serviced the song to contemporary hit radio stations in Italy. British radio station BBC Radio 1 added it to rotation on March 12, followed by its sister station BBC Radio 2 the next day.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\n\"Hold On\" is a mid-tempo synth-pop song that contains a driving pop rock beat and is set in the key of C\u266f minor. Chris DeVille from Stereogum wrote that the song \"delve[s] into the synth-powered side of '80s rock\". The song's two verses have light synths laid down before eventually transitioning to a punchy chorus where the music drops and the percussion takes over, all layering under Bieber's vocals. Roisin O'Connor of The Independent stated that the song's synths faintly recall Alphaville's \"Forever Young\", while its bassline is in the style of Fleetwood Mac. \"Hold On\" is about keeping faith during difficult and challenging times, with lyrics touching on Bieber's struggles with the spotlight over the years. In the chorus, Bieber promises that \"Heaven is a place not too far away\" and admits to \"know[ing] how it feels to be someone who loses their way\". Rachel Simon, writing for NBC Think, opined that on the track, Bieber \"offers himself up as an example of how people can change for the better\" and \"act[s] as the support system his younger self wasn't lucky enough to have\".\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Hold On\" debuted at number seven on the Canadian Hot 100 issued for March 20, 2021. The song peaked at number four in its third week on the chart. On the US Billboard Hot 100, it reached number 20. \"Hold On\" charted at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. In Australia, the song peaked at number six and went Platinum. It reached number seven in New Zealand. \"Hold On\" peaked within the top 10 of national record charts, at number two in Denmark, number six in Malaysia, Singapore, number seven in Norway, number eight in Ireland, and number nine in Belgium, the Netherlands.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Hold On\" received critical acclaim by music critics. Crimson staff writer Angelina Shoemaker praised the track for \"[refreshing] listeners with its straightforward message.\" This message, according to Shoemaker, \"touches on an emotion close to many\". Shoemaker also noted the musical rhythm and melody as a form of communication of feelings, with the feeling of loneliness conveyed by the track's \"slow-wave rhythm\" and the \"expressive quality of his voice.\"\nA review at The Musical Hype on March 8, 2021, three days after the track's release, rated the song 3.5 stars out of 5, and praised the lyrical content for offering \"encouragement and support\", as well as praising Bieber's messaging and writing and singing performance, stating that Bieber \"sounds smooth and performs expressively\". The reviewer's overall opinion of the song is largely positive, calling it a \"winner for Justin Bieber.\"Music blogger Thomas Bleach, who had previously reviewed other works of Bieber such as \"Holy\" and \"Lonely\", praised the message of hope and reassurance and enlightenment in the track's lyrics, noting its structural parallels to Gotye's 2011 top-hit \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", and further going on to praise Bieber's vocals. Overall, Thomas rates the song positively, and rates the song as a \"strong and decisive moment\", contrasting it to Changes, which Thomas rated negatively by calling it \"monotonous.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nColin Tilley directed the music video for \"Hold On\", which stars Bieber and Taiwanese-American actress Christine Ko. Bieber shared a teaser of the clip on Instagram ahead of its release, followed by a livestream celebrating its release. It premiered at midnight on March 5, 2021. The video begins with policemen chasing Bieber and successfully shooting him, followed by a flashback. It is then revealed Bieber is trying to arrange money to pay Ko's medical bills, as her character is suffering from cancer. He spray paints a gun and resolves to steal money from a bank.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nBieber performed \"Hold On\" during his Tiny Desk Concert, which premiered online on March 17, 2021. The next day, he performed the song on The Late Late Show with James Corden, with a backing band, surrounded by the image of a winding road projected on a green screen. Bieber performed it at Good Morning America on March 22; Justin Curto of Vulture stated that Bieber \"rocked the distanced GMA stage, jumping around and playing off his band's energy\". Three days later, he released the official Vevo Live performance for \"Hold On\", which was held in a deserted forest in Los Angeles amid red mood lighting and green and white lightning. Bieber \"dance[d] and [ran]\" during it, backed by two guitarists, a keyboardist, and a live drummer. In May 2, he performed the song on Big Brother Brasil 21.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The song went on to win Favorite Latin Song at the 2021 American Music Awards.\nThe song was sent to contemporary hit radio in the United States on April 6, 2021.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Telepat\u00eda\" is a song about a long-distance relationship that sees Uchis sing in Spanish about making love to her partner telepathically while they are apart. Additionally, the lyrics are notably gender neutral, and the song could be construed as Uchis referring to a person of any gender, seemingly as per Uchis's bisexuality.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Telepat\u00eda\" ranked as the fifth best song of 2021 by Billboard, stating that \"not only essential for its addictive groove and inspired lyrical content, the pop gem also put a spotlight on truly bilingual songs having chart potential.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nOn March 18, 2021 the official music video for \"Telepat\u00eda\" was released. It sees Uchis stroll around her hometown of Pereira, Colombia and was directed by the artist herself. For the video, Kali Uchis said she wanted \"Nothing overproduced, just the beautiful natural magic of the country I have had the honor of also calling home my entire life, Colombia.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nTelepat\u00eda (acoustic) \u2013 Single\n\n\"Telepat\u00eda\" (acoustic) \u2013 2:58\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Billboard number-one Latin songs of 2021\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nhttps://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/columns/latin/9575275/kali-uchis-earns-first-hot-latin-songs-chart-no-1-with-telepatia\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"ABCDEFU\" (stylized in all lowercase, also known by its radio edited title \"ABC\") is the major-label debut single by American singer Gayle, released on August 13, 2021, through Atlantic and Arthouse Records.

On her TikTok, Gayle uploaded a video where she stated \"I'm out of [song] ideas\" and asked followers to comment song ideas. \"Comment anything and I'll try my best to turn it into a song.\" One user commented asking for a song that incorporates the alphabet. Within a few days, she uploaded another video of her strumming what became the chorus of the song. After being accused of staging a marketing ploy, Atlantic Records later confirmed that the comment was left by Nancy Berman, a marketing manager at the label, stating that it was \"simply a playful comment\".According to Gayle, the song \"came from a place of trying so hard to be the nice, respectful ex-girlfriend, to the point where it was negatively affecting me\". In an interview with Tongue Tied Mag, Gayle explained the inspiration behind the song: \"After the breakup, I was trying really, really hard to be a nice person\u2014like, overcompensating for it\u2014like, the week after we broke up, I called him and was, like, 'Hey, bud!' and 'What's up, my friend?!'\". On March 31, 2021, Gayle revealed on Instagram that she had deliberately broken her middle finger, and the X-ray scan from the hospital was used for the single's cover art.The song achieved mainstream success within a few months after release, surpassing over 500 million global streams as of March 2022. The singer has since released different versions of the song, including the demo, a \"chill version\", and an \"angrier version\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe accompanying music video was released on August 13, 2021. The video was shot via a camcorder with 4:3 aspect ratio at a low resolution to evoke an early 2000s home video feel. In the music video, the singer and her friends visit and look around her ex's home.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nAccording to the digital sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Warner Music Publishing, \"ABCDEFU\" is written in the key of E major with a tempo of 122 beats per minute. The song's title and lyrical content are a play on words incorporating the first six letters of the alphabet with the addition of the twenty-first to form an initialism for a profane phrase i.e. Fuck yoU.\nSonically the song is characterized by \"minimalistic sonics\" and \"jagged guitar work\", while it \"reaches its climax with a massive sing-a-long chorus\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nGayle's song has been a viral hit on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. Emily Zemler of Rolling Stone praised the passion of Gayle's live renditions of the piece. April Bredael of Tongue Tied Magazine thought the song \"adds to a growing list of accomplishments\" of the singer with tracks that are \"authentic, honest, and unapologetic\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nDigital download and streaming\n\"ABCDEFU\"  \u2013 2:48Digital download and streaming (Nicer version)\n\"ABC\" (nicer)  \u2013 2:48Digital download and streaming (Demo version)\"ABCDEFU\" (demo)  \u2013 2:35Digital download and streaming (Chill version)\n\"ABCDEFU\" (chill)  \u2013 2:56Digital download and streaming (Angrier version)\n\"ABCDEFU\" (angrier)  \u2013 2:39Digital download and streaming (featuring Royal & the Serpent)\n\"ABCDEFU\" (featuring Royal & the Serpent)  \u2013 2:49Digital download and streaming (The Wild Remix)\n\"ABC\" (The Wild Remix)  \u2013 3:02\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"My Head & My Heart\" is a song by American singer Ava Max, released on November 19, 2020, through Atlantic Records. It was included on the digital reissue of Max's debut studio album, Heaven & Hell (2020). The dance and pop anthem was written by Max, Madison Love, Aleksey Potekhin, Sergey Zhukov, Tia Scola, Earwulf, and Cirkut, with production handled by the latter two producers and Jonas Blue. It interpolates the 2000 song \"Around the World (La La La La La)\" by ATC, which is a cover of the 1998 composition \"Pesenka\" by Ruki Vverh!.\n\"My Head & My Heart\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the production. The song peaked at number 45 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and at number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. It is certified platinum in three countries and certified gold in four countries. An accompanying music video was directed by Charm La'Donna and Emil Nava and depicts Max and a group of dancers performing choreography inside a nightclub. Max performed the song at several televised events.\n\n\n== Background and development ==\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Max wanted to create a song which would allow people to dance while they were at home. Development of \"My Head & My Heart\" occurred from September to November 2020, which she intended to release the song in the \"right moment\". It is the first single exclusively released from the digital reissue of Max's debut studio album Heaven & Hell (2020). It was written by Max, Madison Love, Aleksey Potekhin, Sergey Zhukov, Tia Scola, and producers Cirkut, and Earwulf. Jonas Blue was also involved in the song's production.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nMusically, \"My Head & My Heart\" is a dance and pop anthem, which contains a heavy-layered beat with an electronic sound. According to the song's sheet music that was published on Musicnotes.com, it is set in the time signature of 44 common time, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, while composed in the key of A minor. Max's voice on the track ranges from the low note of G3 to the high note of E5, while the song is constructed in verse\u2013chorus form. \"My Head & My Heart\" interpolates ATC's 2000 Eurodance song \"Around the World (La La La La La)\", which in turn is a cover of the 1998 song \"Pesenka\" by Ruki Vverh!. The \"Pesenka\" songwriters, Zhukov and Potekhin are consequently credited as co-writers on \"My Head & My Heart\".The lyrics describe a confrontation between Max and her ex-boyfriend that the former cannot get out of her head, which she subsequently \"calls upon an old flame to repair her broken heart\" on the sing-song hook used in \"Around the World (La La La La La)\". The contrast of \"head\" and \"heart\" is referred to as another form of duality, reinforcing the concept of Max's album title Heaven & Hell.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting for Billboard, Gab Ginsberg and Jason Lipshutz praised \"My Head & My Heart\" as a \"sweaty, shimmering dance banger\". Both writers acknowledged that it allowed the next generation to hear \"Around the World (La La La La La)\". Carolyn Droke of Uproxx stated that the song was \"a thumping ode to freedom\", while Mike Wass of Idolator described it as \"irresistible\" with a \"catchy chorus\". Writing for HuffPost, Curtis M. Wong noted that the song is an \"exuberant, club-thumping ode to romantic conflict\".\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nIn the United States, \"My Head & My Heart\" debuted at number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated February 20, 2021, eventually peaking at number 45 on the chart dated March 13, 2021. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on September 23, 2021, for sales of 500,000 certified units in the United States. It also reached number 13 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart dated March 20, 2021. In Canada, \"My Head & My Heart\" debuted at number 88 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart dated March 27, 2021, and peaked at number 21. It received a double platinum certification on April 8, 2022, for sales of 160,000 equivalent-units in the country.In the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number 98 on the UK Singles Chart dated January 14, 2021. It peaked at number 18 on the chart dated March 26, 2021, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on July 30, 2021, for sales of 400,000 equivalent-units. On the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, \"My Head & My Heart\" peaked at number 21 on the chart dated March 8, 2021, and received a platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for selling over 70,000 equivalent-units in the country.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nIn November 2020, a lyric video of \"My Head & My Heart\" was released. A video for the acoustic version of the song was released on February 11, 2021. Max is seen performing with three female string musicians inside a room covered in red lighting. Her usual blonde hair is colored black, although it is still shaped as the 'Max Cut'. Andrea Dresdale of ABC News Radio noted that the visual was a \"cute nod\" to the song lyric, \"I picture all the perfect that we lived / 'Til I cut the strings on your tiny violin\". A performance video was released on February 19, 2021, which depicts British drag queen Bimini Bon-Boulash of RuPaul's Drag Race UK lip syncing the song at the Heaven superclub. The video encouraged viewers to support the charity Mermaids.In an interview with the Hit Network on February 4, 2021, Max stated that an accompanying music video for \"My Head & My Heart\" was in development, which she declared as her \"sexiest music video yet!\". It was filmed under restrictive COVID-19 guidelines, as members on set were COVID-19 tested several times and wore masks between scenes. The music video was released on February 25, 2021, and is directed by Charm La'Donna and Emil Nava. Max acknowledged that it contrasted from her previous videos by stating that it was both \"vulnerable\" and \"dance-inspired\", as she envisioned the music video's concept while writing the song. It depicts Max and a cohort of dancers writhing, gyrating, and performing choreography inside a nightclub. She wore several outfits such as a small crop top, red mesh, glitter-covered leather, and a pair of Skechers D'Lites Biggest Fan sneakers.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nMax appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! to perform \"My Head & My Heart\" on February 25, 2021, which coincided with the release of the music video. During the performance, she navigated through a large cage while the dancers surrounded her. Max performed the song on the March 29, 2021 episode of American morning television program Good Morning America, and on the May 6, 2021 episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show. During the opening party of the Attitude Pride at Home concert on June 23, 2021, Max performed acoustic versions of the 2020 song \"Kings & Queens\" and \"My Head & My Heart\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Ghost\" is a song by Canadian singer Justin Bieber. It was sent to French radio stations through Universal Music Group on September 10, 2021, as the sixth single from his sixth studio album, Justice. Bieber wrote the song with producers Jon Bellion and the Monsters & Strangerz (Jordan K. Johnson and Stefan Johnson), alongside Michael Pollack. Commercially, \"Ghost\" reached number one in Malaysia and Singapore and charted within the top ten in Canada, Indonesia, Ireland, Lebanon, the Philippines, and the United States.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBieber explained that his objective with the creation of \"Ghost\" was to \"make people feel like there is hope and that the trauma and the hurt that you feel isn't gonna last forever\". In a Zoom playback of Justice, he acknowledged that 2021 \"has been a really challenging year where we've lost loved ones and relationships\" during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bieber went on to say that the song's hook \"works for this quarantine situation\" since \"we're not relating and connecting in the same way\", which in turn \"has allowed us to only really have these memories\". On February 20, 2022, American singer-songwriter Jon Bellion, who was involved in the songwriting and production of \"Ghost\", also explained through a tweet that he wrote the song about his late grandmother.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\n\"Ghost\" is an uptempo pop rock and synth-pop ballad. The song is set in the key of D major with a tempo of 77 beats per minute. It meshes electronic dance music (EDM) with drum and bass and makes use of a folky acoustic guitar, busy programmed drums, and shimmering EDM synthesizers. Uproxx's Bianca Gracie described the track as leaning into the adult contemporary genre \"with its radio-friendly acoustic guitar riffs\". The song's chattering beats give way to an acoustic guitar strum before the two sounds are brought together on the chorus. Lyrically, the song is about grief caused by the absence of a loved one, with Bieber singing: \"I'll settle for the ghost of you / I miss you more than life.\"\n\n\n== Promotion ==\nTo promote \"Ghost\", Bieber teamed up with Dolby Laboratories to create a long-form commercial for Dolby Atmos including the song. A day later, Billboard chart director Gary Trust announced that the song started being officially promoted to US pop radio. Bieber performed the song at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards, where he sported a hoodie covering most of his face and was accompanied on set by large ice blocks.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAllison Stewart of The Washington Post saw \"Ghost\" as the best song on Justice, writing that the \"rafter-rattling ballad\" is \"perfectly suited to the unique concerns of quarantine\". Similarly, Los Angeles Times pop music critic Mikael Wood considered it one of the album's highlights, noting that the song's drums \"punches up a vaguely creepy emo sentiment\". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard listed it ninth in his ranking of the best songs on Justice, believing that \"Bieber drops one of the best vocal performances on the album here and carries the concept through\". The Evening Standard's David Smyth felt the song's synths were one of the many musically enjoyable aspects on Justice. NME's Will Lavin wrote that the track \"hits hard but imparts a healing guitar riff to cushion the blow\". Anna Clara Ribeiro from PopMatters found it to be the most intriguing song on Justice in terms of production, specifying \"not so much for any of the sounds that prevail in it\", but rather \"for where each of them is placed\". Ribeiro also called it a good lyrical moment of the album. Baby A. Gil of The Philippine Star thought the song \"effortlessly juggles grief and hope while depicting forever love\". Conseqence of Sound's Valerie Magan was less positive about the track, feeling its \"impact remains as barren as the imagery\".\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nUpon the release of Justice, \"Ghost\" charted at number 41 on the Billboard Global 200. It entered several record charts worldwide, including Australia (53), Bieber's home country of Canada (27), Denmark (25), Portugal (114), Slovakia (58), and Sweden (72). In the United States, the song debuted at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 as one of the 11 new entrances off Justice. Following its promotion to pop radio as a single, the song peaked at number two on the Canadian Hot 100 and number 16 on the Billboard Global 200. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated February 19, 2022, \"Ghost\" rose to number nine in its 20th charting week, garnering 62 million airplay impressions, 7.9 million streams, and 3,400 sales. The song earned Bieber his 26th top-ten hit and made him hold the 11th-most top-ten entries in the chart's history. It additionally became his longest climb to reach the top ten, surpassing the 18-week ascent of his 2015 collaboration with American record producers Skrillex and Diplo, \"Where Are \u00dc Now\". The song hit a new peak of number eight the following week while concurrently becoming Bieber's 10th number one on the US Mainstream Top 40, the most among solo males on the chart. \"Ghost\" peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated April 2, 2022, giving Bieber his 20th top-five hit and making him only the 10th act to reach the threshold. The song also found considerable success in Maritime Southeast Asia, reaching number one in Malaysia and Singapore, number two in Indonesia, and number six in the Philippines. As of March 17, 2022, \"Ghost\" has amassed 255 million streams in the US and 830 million streams worldwide.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe official music video for \"Ghost\", directed by Colin Tilley, premiered on October 8, 2021. It coincided with the release of the complete edition of Justice and the Amazon Prime Video documentary, Justin Bieber: Our World. Actress Diane Keaton stars as Bieber's grandmother in the video. The video opens with Bieber playing the piano, celebrating his grandfather's birthday with him and Keaton. The moment is interrupted in the next scene as Bieber and Keaton mourn the death of his grandfather at an ocean-side funeral. Two years after the event, Bieber sees Keaton is still struggling with her husband's passing. He decides to take Keaton for a night out on the town as they attempt to move past their grief. Bieber buys a Gucci dress for Keaton to cheer her up, and they partake in activities such as going on long walks along Ventura Beach and taking shots, toasting, and dancing at a bar. Bieber later encourages Keaton to date again as she looks for eligible bachelors on a dating app called Slide. Bieber then drives Keaton to the beach in a convertible, where she scatters her husband's ashes in the ocean while dolphins jump up to greet them. At the end of the video, Bieber surprises Keaton by setting her up on a date with a new man who slightly resembles her widower.Bieber called Keaton and asked her to be in the video, to which she accepted the offer and expressed fondness for the song. Keaton previously shared a brief interaction with Bieber in 2015 during her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and admitted having a slight crush on him after being shown his Calvin Klein campaign. On October 6, 2021, Bieber and Keaton shared a teaser of the video on their respective Instagram accounts. Speaking about her experience working with Bieber, Keaton said it was \"friendly, open, loose and unique\", adding that he \"was kind to everyone and his team was perfection\". While Keaton had never been in a music video before, she directed two of them for Belinda Carlisle's singles, \"Heaven Is a Place on Earth\" and \"I Get Weak\".\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nJustin Bieber \u2013 vocals, songwriting\nJon Bellion \u2013 songwriting, production, backing vocals, engineering, programming, vocal production\nThe Monsters & Strangerz \u2013 production, bass, drums, keyboards, programming\nJordan K.

            "\"Don't Go Yet\" is a song by Cuban-born American singer Camila Cabello. The song was written by Cabello, Scott Harris, Eric Frederic and Mike Sabath, and produced by the latter two. It was released on July 23, 2021, through Epic Records, as the lead single from her third studio album, Familia. The song was serviced to US contemporary hit radio and rhythmic radio formats on July 27, 2021.\n\"Don't Go Yet\" is a Latin influenced, pop, Latin pop and tropical love song, with a scratchy flamenco guitar, luscious ad-libs and \"handclapping overlapping as\" beats. Lyrically, the song tells a story about being together with someone and never wanting to be apart from them. An accompanying music video, directed by Philippa Price and Pilar Zeta, was released alongside the song launch. The track received its debut performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. \"Don't Go Yet\" received positive reviews from critics, and reached the top-ten in seven countries, as well as the top-twenty in a further seven.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCabello first teased the song on July 14, using her Instagram account by sharing a close-up of her face along with the caption, \"listos?\" which translates from Spanish to English as \"Ready?\". On July 16, 2021, Camila announced via her social media accounts that \"Don't Go Yet\" would be released on July 23. Alongside the announcement, she also revealed the song's cover artwork. The singer is seen wearing a large earring and black outfit teamed with long black gloves. The following week, Cabello continued giving teasers from the \"Don't Go Yet\" music video.According to Cabello, both the song and music video were influenced by \"Cuban-Mexican family parties from her childhood, where 'everybody eats dinner, and then after you put on a little cheap disco ball with lights and suddenly the living room is the dance floor'\".\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Don't Go Yet\" was written by Cabello, Scott Harris, Mike Sabath and Eric Frederic, and produced by the latter two. The song has been described as a Latin pop, pop and tropical love song with a mix of Spanish lyrics. The Latin influenced production consists of strings, maracas, drums, trumpets, and \"handclapping overlapping as\" beats. Opening with \"urgent\", \"scratchy\" flamenco guitar and \"luscious\" ad-libs from Camila, the song plunges into swift, thumping beats. Eschewing synths and vocoders, Camila's voice is \"soulful\" over real instruments, from textured maracas to soaring horns.The track also features live percussion by Cuban drummer Pedrito Martinez. The song is about the singer being together with someone and never wanting to be apart from them. The singer tells her man to shrug off his ideas of an early night and stay with her, but then explodes, as its titular phrase becomes the rallying cry of an effusive, sashaying choir. In terms of musical notation, the song is composed in the key of C minor, with a tempo of 110 beats per minute, and runs for two minutes and 44 seconds. Christine Hahn of Los Angeles Times noted that \"the arrangements, especially in the choir\" are reminiscent of the great Cuban orchestras of the '50s, in which a brass explosion marked the beginning of the choir and a complex percussion \"made it clear that the songs were tropical.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe song received positive reviews from music critics. Describing the song as \"fun\" and \"exuberant\", The New York Times's Lindsay Zoladz wrote \"Cabello leans harder than ever into her Latin-pop roots here, but also noted that there's a \"sassy rasp\" to her vocals that \"reminds of Doja Cat.\" Writing for Entertainment Tonight, Meredith B. Kile\u200d named the song as \"a Cuban percussion-infused, dance floor-ready single.\" Anamaria Sayre of NPR Music considered that the song \"meshes sounds and instrumentation not only from her own Cuban heritage but Latin America at large: From rumba rhythms to flamenco claves and everything in between,\" and the singer \"once again positions herself as la reina del Latin pop.\" Writing for The Daily Aztec, Trinity Bland opined that the song is a Cuban Miami music milestone, because \"Cabello is carrying that torch (taking Latin pop to an international mainstream level) with the song and it can be easy to compare her to a young Gloria in this colorful single as she authentically presents her Cuban culture to fans, reaching a global audience and having fun while doing so.\" Furthermore, Bland also compared the song to Gloria Estefan's multiple remarkable hits, \"her chant-worthy chorus reminiscent of the iconic 'O ey, o ey' from 'Rhythm Is Gonna Get You' or the emphasis on dancing like in the remarkably acclaimed 'Conga'.\" Cosmopolitan named \"Don't Go Yet\" 32nd on their list of the 55 Best New Songs of 2021.\n\n\n=== Year-end lists ===\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nIn the United States, \"Don't Go Yet\" debuted and peaked at Number 42 on the Billboard Hot 100 spending 9 weeks on the chart.

            "Faouzia Ouihya (Arabic: \u0641\u0648\u0632\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0648\u064a\u062d\u064a\u0649, Fawziya Uw\u012b\u1e25iya; born 5 July 2000), known mononymously as Faouzia, is a Moroccan-Canadian singer-songwriter and musician best known for her blockbuster Solo Track \"RIP, Love\"(2022).

She released several singles and collaborated with many musicians on vocals and songwriting prior to releasing her debut extended play (EP), Stripped, in August 2020.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== 2000\u20132014: Early life ===\nFaouzia Ouihya was born in Casablanca, Morocco and moved with her family at the age of one to Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes, Manitoba in Canada, before settling in the rural town of Carman, Manitoba. She has two sisters: Samia (one of her managers) and Kenza (her photographer). She was raised Muslim and often traveled to her native country. Faouzia said she feels \"very connected to the country and the region [North Africa]. Even though I grew up in Canada, I grew up eating Moroccan food, [and] wearing Moroccan attire.\" In an interview she revealed she felt excluded as a child, saying \"maybe not just fitting in is the biggest thing I've had to overcome\". Her first composition was inspired by this feeling of exclusion, in which she embraced people's differences. Her passion for music began at the age of four when she watched her sister Samia playing the piano, wishing she could learn how to play it. Faouzia began writing songs and poems when she was five years old and playing piano at the age of six. She later studied how to play guitar and violin. She speaks fluent English, French, and Arabic; the latter being the one she mostly used with her family.\n\n\n=== 2015\u20132019: Career beginnings ===\nAt the age of fifteen, she won Song of the Year, the Audience Award, and Grand Prix at the 2015 La Chicane \u00c9l\u00e9ctrique. She began posting her songs and other covers on YouTube which led to a contract with Paradigm Talent Agency. Thanks to her early success, she released her debut single \"Knock on My Door\" on 1 November through various platforms.In 2016, she won second place in the Canada's Walk of Fame Emerging Artist Mentorship Program. In 2017, she was the recipient of the Grand Prize at the Nashville Unsigned Only music competition. The same year, she collaborated with fellow Manitoban artist Matt Epp on their single \"The Sound\", and won the International Songwriting Competition, the largest songwriting competition in the world. The two are the first Canadians in competition's 16-year history to win the top prize, beating 16,000 other entries from 137 countries. She performed with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra at The Forks, Winnipeg celebrating the 150th anniversary of Canada.Faouzia is featured in the song \"Battle\" on David Guetta's studio album 7, announced on 24 August 2018. In a French language interview with Le Matin, Guetta noted Faouzia's \"great voice, powerful vibrato, and unique style\" for why he chose her for his album. Faouzia recalled she \"was still in high school when I heard the news that there was a possibility of me working with him\", and affirmed it was \"one of my proudest career moments, so far.\" At that time, she enrolled in the University of Manitoba, majoring in computer engineering. She also featured in the song \"Money\" on French rapper Ninho's studio album Destin and the song got certified \"Gold Single\" on 9 July 2019.\n\n\n=== 2020\u2013present: Stripped and upcoming album ===\nIn early 2020, she was invited by Kelly Clarkson to translate her song \"I Dare You\" to Moroccan Arabic, which was released on 16 April. About a month later, the Swedish EDM duo Galantis invited her to feature in their song \"I Fly\" for the soundtrack of the movie SCOOB!.Faouzia released her first extended play (EP), Stripped, on 6 August 2020. It features 6 stripped (acoustic version) songs, 5 of which were previously released, and one of which, \"100 Bandaids\", is a new track. To promote the EP, Faouzia performed the tracks live in a concert at the Burton Cummings Theatre on 20 August.On 5 November 2020, she released the single \"Minefields\" alongside American singer-songwriter John Legend. In July 2021, Faouzia revealed that she has been working on her debut studio album for a few years. She also released the singles \"Don't Tell Me I'm Pretty\", \"Hero\" , \"Puppet\" and \"RIP, Love\".\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Musical style and themes ===\nFaouzia is a pop, R&B, synth-pop, and acoustic pop artist. She has described her music as \"emotional\" and \"intense\". Her early songwriting was heavily inspired by people she was close to. However, her later songs were more personal since she \"really wanted my heart in my story.\" Gloria Morey noted that her music has \"the musical elements of upbeat pop songs which often contain quite shallow lyrics, but Faouzia\u2019s lyrics are very meaningful and, well, the opposite of shallow. Faouzia possesses a potential coloratura mezzo-soprano vocal range that spans from E\u266d3 to G\u266f5 in mixed voice and A6 in whistle tones. Faouzia sings mostly in English language, featuring Arabic tonalities in her vocals. She has also performed in Arabic and in French language.\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nFaouzia cites her parents and sisters as her biggest influence in pursuing a music career. She grew up listening to pop musicians Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Rosal\u00eda, Beyonc\u00e9, Sia, Adele, Kelly Clarkson, and John Legend. About Rihanna, she said \"has always been an inspiration of mine growing up and still to this day.\" Faouzia added that she, Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, and Sia are her mayor influences as a songwriter. She told that \"Say Something\" by A Great Big World and \"Hello\" by Adele are some of her favourite songs. At a young age she listened alongside her parents to Arab music acts such as Umm Kulthum and Fairuz. Faouzia declared they \"are two of my all-time favourite artists.\" She also listened to Assala Nasri and Khaled. When she was learning music she listened to composers Chopin, Bach, and Mozart. Pop rock bands Fall Out Boy and Imagine Dragons have also served as influences for her, and she attended one of the latter's concerts.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\nNotes\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n=== Videography ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nFaouzia on Twitter \nFaouzia on Instagram \nFaouzia on TikTok \nFaouzia on Spotify",

            "\"Follow You\" is a song by American band Imagine Dragons. The song was released through Interscope and Kidinakorner on March 12, 2021, as one of the double lead singles from their fifth studio album, Mercury \u2013 Act 1. It was written by band members Dan Reynolds, Wayne Sermon, Ben McKee, and Daniel Platzman, alongside Joel Little, Fransisca Hall, and Elley Duh\u00e9, and produced by Little.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nIn early March 2021, the band started teasing towards the release by posting various teasers before announcing the songs on March 8. \"Follow You\" and  \"Cutthroat\" mark the first solo releases from Imagine Dragons since their 2018 album, Origins.\"Follow You\" was inspired by frontman Dan Reynolds' relationship with his wife Aja Volkman.  Reynolds wrote the song soon after receiving a \"life-changing\" text from Volkman, having not spoken to her in seven months, while on his way to finalize their divorce. About the writing process, he revealed, \"I wrote 'Follow You' after we got back together. I wanted it to represent a love that is realistic. One where love isn't perfect but it endures\".\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Follow You\" peaked at No. 68 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also wrapped the group's quickest climb to No. 1 on Alternative Airplay, usurping the seven-week ascents for \"Believer\" in 2017 and \"Natural\" in 2018. That same week, it had 5.1 million audience impressions, up 15% from the previous week, according to MRC Data.Nearly two months after leading Billboard's Alternative Airplay chart, \"Follow You\" went number one the all-rock-format, audience-based Rock & Alternative Airplay survey, rising 2-1 on the list dated June 19.\nThe song reigns with 7 million audience impressions, up 2%, in the week ending June 13, according to MRC Data.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video involves It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia stars Kaitlin Olson and creator Rob McElhenney, who was given this concert for his birthday, despite Imagine Dragons being Kaitlyn's favorite and Rob's favorite being The Killers, who, like ID, come from Las Vegas. Both of them imagine different wild fantasies while hearing them perform \"Follow You\". After the song, both of them leave, to which Dan Reynolds tells them they have 10 more songs to perform, though the two still leave \"before they play Radioactive\".\n\n\n== Track listings and formats ==\n7\" vinyl/CD single/digital download/streaming\"Follow You\" \u2013 2:55\n\"Cutthroat\" \u2013 2:49Digital download/streaming \u2013 Summer '21 Version\"Follow You\" (Summer '21 Version) \u2013 2:52Streaming \u2013 Summer '21 Version (Spotify edition)\"Follow You\" (Summer '21 Version) \u2013 2:52\n\"Follow You\" \u2013 2:56\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

A beacon of joy and strength for everyone she met. Her sudden passing has shaken me in ways that I still am unable to express. I was with her and my brother when she passed, and it was the first time in my life that I had witnessed death in this way. It sealed into my mind the fragility of life and finality of this all. I\u2019ve watched my brother face something that no one should have to. But I\u2019ve also seen his faith bring him hope in a future with her. I can only hope for the same.\"He described the song was his \"way of dealing with it all, as music has always been my refuge. No longer being a man of fervent faith, I can only hope that she hears it somewhere in a place where she is healed and no longer in pain. This song is my wish for an eternity with those that I love.\"\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from AllMusic.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Shy Away\" is a song written and recorded by American musical duo Twenty One Pilots. It was released on April 7, 2021, through Fueled by Ramen, as the lead single from their sixth studio album, Scaled and Icy. A music video was released alongside the single, directed by Miles Cable and AJ Favicchio.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nTyler Joseph, the frontman of the duo, wrote \"Shy Away\" for his younger brother, Jay Joseph, as a tutorial on how to operate a recording studio. During the recording, Joseph's daughter made a cooing noise which Joseph decided to keep in the song.The song was created while communicating virtually as the COVID-19 pandemic limited interaction between the members of the band. It was released two days after the announcement of Scaled and Icy, the band's sixth studio album.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Shy Away\" is a \"propulsive\" synth-pop, alternative rock, indie rock, and pop rock song that runs for a duration of two minutes and fifty-five seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music, it is written in the time signature of common time at a tempo of 196 beats per minute. \"Shy Away\" is composed in the key of C major, while Joseph's vocal range spans one octave and three notes, from a low E3 to a high of A4.The track includes a \"brief but tasteful\" half-time breakdown for the \"hardcore kids\", and has been compared to the likes of artists such as the Strokes and Phoenix. It's considered to be one of the band's upbeat songs, and is synth-heavy, with elements of electronic, pop and indie music.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for the song, directed by Miles Cable and AJ Favicchio, was released concurrently with the song. The video showcases the duo's new \"era\", and a new color scheme which changes during each album cycle. The video features the new colors prominently: vibrant shades of light blue, pink and occasional yellow. In the video, a few background musicians portrayed by Joseph and Dun wear torn and burnt ski masks, a reference to the stylings of their earlier albums, Vessel and Blurryface. As of February 2022, the video has surpassed 43 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nWithin only two days of tracking, \"Shy Away\" made its debut at No. 20 on the US Billboard Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart, and reached a peak of No. 7. On the Alternative Airplay chart, the song peaked at No. 1, and remained at the peak position for 8 weeks. On the Rock Airplay chart, the track also reached No. 1. In its first full week of tracking, it reached No. 56 in both the United Kingdom and Ireland, and peaked at No. 36 in Lithuania. On the chart dated April 24, 2021, the song made its debut on the US Billboard Hot 100 at No. 87, before falling out the week after.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Scaled and Icy.\nTyler Joseph \u2013 vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, synthesizers, programming, production\nJosh Dun \u2013 drums, percussion\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Shy Away\" music video on YouTube",

The vocals in the song span from F\u266f3 to D5.The song features Lizzo \"talking her shit over a simple piano melody. It quickly warps into anonymous, stomping future funk, complete with rubbery synth, handclaps, and electric guitar.\" Lyrically, it \"sees Lizzo confront the 'shit on the intern\u0435t' that's clung to her since she conquered the mainstream in 2019.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nRating it with five stars out of five, Nick Levine of NME stated that \"Rumors\" is a \"brilliant return from Lizzo that combines her signature sense of fun with some well-placed spikiness.\" Dubbing it \"half a twerk jam and half a radio jingle\" that \"will be a big hit\", Vulture's Craig Jenkins opined that \"the journey from the rote, familiar drums and bass underneath the verses to the trippy harmonies and boisterous big-band arrangements around the chorus is too slow of a build.\" Comparing it to \"Truth Hurts\", Eric Torres of Pitchfork wrote that \"Rumors\" \"feels slapped together from different parts of Lizzo's past hits: the bellowing horns, squealing guitar solos, and endless confidence are all here. This time, though, the formula feels strained.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Rumors\" debuted at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lizzo's third and Cardi B's tenth top 10 single on the chart. Lizzo also achieved her third number one and Cardi B her seventh on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It debuted at number three on the Rolling Stone Top 100 moving 136,000 units, including 15 million US streams. It also became Lizzo's first entry on Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. US, debuting at numbers 12 and 29, respectively.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe video for \"Rumors\", directed by Tanu Muino, references the Muses from Disney's Hercules in a set inspired by ancient Greece. The closing pose echoes the neoclassical painting Oath of the Horatii by Jacques-Louis David. During the video Lizzo and Cardi wear golden attires, togas, and Ionic column-inspired headdress, as artwork gets animated.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nLizzo \u2013 vocals, songwriting\nCardi B \u2013 featured vocals, songwriting\nRicky Reed \u2013 songwriting, production, programming, horn arrangement, bass synthesizer, keyboards\nNate Mercereau \u2013 songwriting, co-production, guitar, keyboards\nTele \u2013 songwriting, co-production, programming, guitar, keyboards\nTheron Thomas \u2013 songwriting\nTorae Carr \u2013 songwriting\nDonald Hayes \u2013 alto vocals, tenor vocals, baritone saxophone\nLemar Guillary \u2013 horn arrangement, trombone, bass trombone\nThomas Pridgen \u2013 drums\nMike Cordone \u2013 flugelhorn, trumpet\nVictor Indrizzo \u2013 percussion\nMichelle Mancini \u2013 mastering\nManny Marroquin \u2013 mixing\nLeslie Brathwaite \u2013 vocal mixing\nBill Malina \u2013 engineering\nEvan LaRay \u2013 engineering\nPatrick Kehrier \u2013 assistant engineering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"One Right Now\" is a song by American rapper and singer Post Malone and Canadian singer-songwriter the Weeknd. It was released through Republic Records on November 5, 2021, as the lead single from Malone's upcoming fourth studio album, Twelve Carat Toothache (2022).\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn November 2, 2021, Post Malone and the Weeknd posted a 7-second snippet of the song titled \"PM&TW-ORN-Update.5.nonhyped.w1.mp3\" on their Instagram accounts. The post received over 150,000 likes in just an hour. While it was initially unknown what the title of the song was going to be, Malone's manager Dre London revealed that the collaboration would be titled \"One Right Now\". The song marks the first time the artists appeared on a song together.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nBased on the teaser, the sound was described as \"a synthy midtempo club track\". It sees the two \"harmonizing over an upbeat instrumental\". Writing for Billboard, Starr Bowenbank referred to the instrumental as a \"poppy synth beat\". Alex Zidel of HotNewHipHop predicted that the song will \"dominate the radio for the remainder of the year, and likely well into next\". For the radio, The Weeknd decided to replace his lyric censors from the official clean version with newly recorded lyrics, which are \"You think it's so easy messin' with my feelings\" and \"You probably slap all my enemies\". But Post Malone preferred to leave his lyric censors as they are. They both sang \"That you told me that he fucked you on\" twice, separate then together, and tying to Post Malone's record label, it was also left censored. \n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for \"One Right Now\", directed by Tanu Muino, was released on November 15, 2021. In the video, Malone and the Weeknd engage in a shootout with each other's teams, and concludes with them shooting each other at the same time.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal and Genius.\nPost Malone \u2013 vocals, songwriting\nThe Weeknd \u2013 vocals, songwriting\nLouis Bell \u2013 songwriting, production, recording engineering, vocal production, keyboards, synthesizer, programming, drums\nAndrew Bolooki \u2013 songwriting, production, programming, synthesizer\nBrian Lee \u2013 songwriting, production\nBilly Walsh \u2013 songwriting\nManny Marroquin \u2013 mixing\nMike Bozzi \u2013 mastering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOne Right Now (Audio) on YouTube\nOne Right Now (Lyric video) on YouTube",

The group performed the song for the first time on The Confetti Tour.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nGalantis, David Guetta, and Little Mix began work on \"Heartbreak Anthem\" before the coronavirus pandemic. The song originally featured vocals from Little Mix member Jesy Nelson, but after her departure from the group in 2020 the song's vocal arrangement was changed and was released in 2021 as the group's first single as a trio.On 14 May 2021, the song was teased by all three artists by posting a link to a website that displayed a 24-hour timer. On 14 May, after the timer finished \"Heartbreak Anthem\" was announced through all three artists' social media.\nIt started with just the chord progression at a studio in London right before the pandemic. As many collaborations have gone in these times, it was a remote work in progress for months, with stems sent back and forth from London to Los Angeles to Stockholm to Paris. We'd been talking with [David Guetta] about working together for a long time, and having Little Mix and their unique, strong vocals has made this one really special.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting for Vulture, Zoe Haylock wrote that \"Heartbreak Anthem\" is \"far from a sad song, but something about listening to a dance track when there's actually a possibility of dancing soon is emotional\". DJ Times' Brian Bonavoglia stated the collaboration as an \"uplifting sing-a-long that is impossible not to fall in love with\". Euphoria Magazine complemented the song as an \"absolute dance-pop banger\" and \"free-spirited\". Katie Bain from Billboard wrote that \"the song's production is built from brightly plucky strings and synth, with the lyrics \u2013 in the grand tradition of Destiny's Child's \"Survivor\" \u2013 focused on being better than that: not holding grudges, understanding that while sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't, and that while maybe we'll fix this, it's also possible we won't. Whatever! Who cares!\" From ThatGrapeJuice, Sam Ajilore applauded the music video and stating the song is \"rich in summer smash potential\".\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nIn the United Kingdom \"Heartbreak Anthem\" debuted at number nine on the Official UK Singles Chart, becoming Galantis' fourth, Guetta's 24th and Little Mix's 17th top 10 single.

That same week, the title track of Little Mix's sixth studio album, Confetti (2020), charted at number nine, marking the first time the group had two songs in the top ten on the UK Singles Chart since 2016, when the group's singles \"Touch\" and \"Shout Out to My Ex\" were at numbers four and six respectively. The song later reached a new peak of number three on the UK Singles Chart during its seventh week charting, becoming Galantis' highest charting single there. That same week, the song was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in the United Kingdom for selling 200,000 units in the country. In its tenth week on the UK Singles Chart, \"Heartbreak Anthem\" remained inside the top ten at number seven, making Little Mix the first girl group to spend a total of 100 weeks in the top ten of the UK Singles Chart. It was ranked as the fourth-biggest song from June to August 2021 in the United Kingdom. \"Heartbreak Anthem\" was ranked as the eighth top of song of 2021 by The Official Big Top 40.In Ireland, the song debuted within the top 20 on the Official Irish Singles Chart, becoming the group's 22nd Top 20 single on the chart.

It topped both the Mediabase US dance radio and the UK Official Big Top 40 charts.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nLittle Mix teased the music video for \"Heartbreak Anthem\" by posting behind-the-scene photos from the video, one day before the official release of the song. The music video for the song, directed by Samuel Douek, was released alongside the song on 20 May 2021. The video features Little Mix members, Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, and Jade Thirlwall in a theatre production. The video opens up with the group dressed as winged angels, each having a microphone accompanying them.Douek said in an Instagram post that \"The concept of the music video is inspired by Angela Carter's infamous 1984 novel Nights at the Circus, a magical realism feminist tale about freedom\". He added that the group portrayed \"The Winged Fatales\", an all singing, all dancing trio who perform night after night to adoring crowds, whilst backstage they feel trapped and alone. The video also features digital images of David Guetta and the Galantis. Douek also stated that \"The video touches upon the pressures of fame and heartbreak, evoking a message of self-acceptance against the backdrop of a sci-fi burlesque world\". The video for the song currently has 40 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UK top-ten singles in 2021\nList of top 10 singles in 2021 (Ireland)\nList of UK Dance Singles Chart number ones of 2021\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLyric video (Little Mix) on YouTube\nLyric video (David Guetta) on YouTube",

            "\"Oh My God\" is a song recorded by English singer-songwriter Adele for her fourth studio album, 30 (2021). It was released as the second single from the album on 29 November 2021 through Columbia Records. The song was written by Adele and her producer Greg Kurstin. \"Oh My God\" reached the top 5 in Ireland, Lithuania,  New Zealand, Sweden,  the United Kingdom and the United States while reaching the top 10 in Australia, Canada, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, and Switzerland, making 30 Adele's second album with multiple top-five singles in the US, after 21 (2011).\n\n\n== Background and reception ==\nAnnounced on 1 November 2021 as part of the tracklist, the song appeared as the fifth track on Adele's album 30. About the song and its meaning, the singer revealed that it was \"about the first time that I basically left my house after my anxiety and stuff like that started to sort of subside\". After having turned 30, she explained that she was terrified of going on dates in Los Angeles. Talking about one of the first times she flirted after her divorce from ex-husband Simon Konecki, she recalled saying, \"'do you mind? I'm married.' And my friends were like, 'but you're not.' And I was like, 'oh shit. OK, oh my God'.\"Upon album release, the song was chosen as \"Song of the Week\" by Consequence. Writers Mary Siroky and Glenn Rowley described the song as \"refreshing\", while lyrically, it \"replaces outright sadness with internal conflict\". David Cobbald of The Line of Best Fit, however, viewed the inclusion of the song on the album as \"questionable\".\"Oh My God\" replaced \"I Drink Wine\", which had been announced as the second single two weeks prior.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nContrasting other tracks on 30, \"Oh My God\" is a dance-pop song incorporating R&B sounds. It deals with a conflict on \"her desire to have fun for once\", while it seems like she never had the chance to do so. The song explores the topic of wanting to \"put yourself out there\" and the consequent difficulties due to being a superstar. Agnes Erickson at TheList.com dedicated an article to the meaning of the song. To her, a \"surprisingly upbeat song about dipping her toes in the romantic pool for the first time\" since the divorce, the lyrics showcase willingness to start dating again after an episode of anxiety that left her \"paralyzed completely\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nA music video for the song was shot on 15 October 2021, the day \"Easy On Me\" was released, and it later premiered on YouTube on 12 January 2022. It was directed by Sam Brown, who also directed the music video for Adele's 2010 single \"Rolling in the Deep\". She teased the music video on her social media accounts on 6 January. The video, shot in black and white, features multiple versions of Adele performing the song in a room filled with wooden chairs accompanied by numerous backup dancers. The music video also features 10-year-old actor, William Delesk.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Oh My God\" debuted at number three on the Billboard Global 200 with 57.6 million streams and 5,200 sold worldwide. With \"Easy on Me\" at number one and \"I Drink Wine\" debuting at number ten, Adele held three simultaneous top-ten hits on the chart. \"Oh My God\" also debuted at number seven on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. with 34.1 million streams and 1,700 sold outside the U.S., marking Adele's second top-ten song on the chart. In the United Kingdom, \"Oh My God\" debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Adele occupied three of the top five spots on the chart, as \"Easy on Me\" reigned at number one and \"I Drink Wine\" debuted at number four.In the United States, \"Oh My God\" debuted at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Adele's sixth top-five hit and ninth top-ten hit. The song debuted at number three on Streaming Songs with 24.2 million streams and number 28 on Digital Song Sales with 3,300 downloads sold, and earned 6.8 million in airplay audience. \"Oh My God\" also reached number 8 on the Adult Pop Airplay and number 11 on the Pop Airplay charts.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "Brazilian singer Anitta has released five studio albums, one live album, two extended plays, 47 singles (as main artist) and 66 music videos. Anitta was discovered by music producer DJ Batutinha via YouTube in 2010. She eventually signed a record deal with Warner Music Brazil in 2013 and released her debut album, Anitta, that same year, which reached number one and was certified as a gold album in Brazil. Her debut album also produced four singles, including the commercially successful hits \"Show das Poderosas\" and \"Zen\".\nRitmo Perfeito (2014) is Anitta's second studio album, which peaked at number two in Brazil and featured five singles, including \"Bl\u00e1 Bl\u00e1 Bl\u00e1\", \"Na Batida\" and \"Ritmo Perfeito\". In 2015, Anitta released her third studio album, Bang, which became her best-selling album to date, selling over 300,000 copies in Brazil.\nIn 2016, Anitta began expanding her success to Latin America. That year, she was featured in a remix of J Balvin's hit single \"Ginza\" and also released \"Sim ou N\u00e3o\", a duet with Colombian singer Maluma. Anitta was later featured on Australian rapper Iggy Azalea's single \"Switch\" and on Major Lazer's \"Sua Cara\" which also features Pabllo Vittar in 2017. That same year, she released \"Paradinha\", her first solo single in Spanish. A series of non-album collaboration singles, such as \"Is That For Me\" with Swedish producer Alesso, \"Downtown\" with J Balvin and \"Vai Malandra\" with MC Zaac, DJ Yuri Martins, the duo Tropkillaz and the American rapper Maejor, followed later in 2017. Kisses (2019) became Anitta's fourth studio album, which received critical acclaim and was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Music Album. Also in 2019, Anitta was featured in a number of songs released by artists such as Madonna, DJ Snake, Sean Paul, Snoop Dogg, Ozuna, Natti Natasha, Sofia Reyes and Rita Ora.\nLater in 2020, Anitta announced her fifth studio album, Visions of Me, and released its lead single \"Me Gusta\", which features Cardi B and Myke Towers, and became Anitta's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. \"Girl from Rio and \"Faking Love\" featuring Saweetie followed as the album's next singles in 2021, both charting on the US Billboard Mainstream Top 40 Airplay chart. Later that year, Anitta released the album's fourth single \"Envolver\", which achieved international charts success, giving Anitta's highest entries on the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S., at numbers five and two, respectively, and broke a string of records, including the Spotify record for most streamed song in a single-day in 2022 (7.278 million), biggest streaming day for a female latin song, as well as the first song by a Brazilian artist and first solo Latin song to reach the top of the Spotify Global Daily chart.

A staff review from Billboard wrote that the song \"sees Perry return to anthemic pop.\" MTV's Patrick Hosken called the song \"belt-ready bop.\" In an article published by Universal Music Poland, the writer said the song \"makes [the listener] immediately charged with the positive energy, in keeping with the song's title.\"In the United States, \"Electric\" debuted at number 25 on Digital Song Sales chart.

It was recorded on Hawaiian island Oahu in such locations as Diamond Head Lighthouse and Kualoa Ranch. United States Coast Guard approved shooting on the island. In the interview with MTV, Perry said that one of the ideas behind the music video was a \"reminder of her trying to figure out who she wanted to be as a teenage artist performing under her given name, Katheryn Hudson.\" Singer also added that she chose Hawaii as clip's location because it \"provided the perfect lush and naturalistic surroundings.\" Shooting took two 12-hour days.Before the shooting, the production team was looking for a \"girl with blonde hair and blue eyes that could play the guitar.\" Meili Aspen Caputo was finally cast to play younger version of the singer in the video. The actress said that her mother received a phone call from the production team, and after a hair color change, Caputo played in the music video. In the interview with MidWeek magazine, the actress shared that being on the set was a \"fun\" experience. In the interview with MTV, Perry further added: \"[Caputo] put her hair in pigtails and she looks identical to this one from that video I have of me playing.\"\n\nGood Morning America shared a thirty-second sneak peek of the \"Electric\" music video on May 13, 2021, which premiered in full the following day. The behind-the-scenes video was published on Perry's official YouTube channel on June 7, 2021.\n\n\n=== Synopsis and reception ===\nThe video starts with Perry and Pikachu hanging out in Hawaii. After the two stop at Diamond Head Lighthouse, they travel back in time. They encounter the younger versions of themselves, who are performing at the farmer's marketplace.

Afterwards, she gets her younger version to join a talent competition being held at the island. By the end of the video, the younger version of Perry gives her first club performance as the older version of Perry and Pikachu looks on from the crowd.Entertainment Weekly's Joey Nolfi and Pure Chart's Yohann Ruelle described the music video as \"adorable.\" Halle Kiefer from Vulture stated that Pichu is the video's highlight.

            "\"Higher Power\" is a song by British rock band Coldplay from their ninth album Music of the Spheres. It was released on 7 May 2021 as the lead single, being written by the band's four members, Federico Vindver and Denise Carite, while production was handled by Max Martin. Oscar Holter and Bill Rahko also helped to co-produce the song, which received generally positive reviews from music critics and was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring an interview with Mark Savage of BBC News, lead vocalist Chris Martin, who is in no relation to Max, said that the song just dropped out the sky: \"I came up with the title first, but struggled to find the melody and lyrics to go with it. Then one day I was staying in this place and the sink was very resonant. And so I started hitting the sink [to make] this beat... and then I went to the piano keyboard, and the song just landed in one go\".\nHe also explained that \"the song is about trying to find the astronaut in all of us, the person that can do amazing things\". The singer later told Zoe Ball that the track had intergalactic origins, saying: \"We've been trying to imagine what music might sound like on other planets, and try to imagine being those other acts, so we're not thinking of ourselves as being the band Coldplay from England\", he explained.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe song was produced by Max Martin, who the band called \"a true wonder of the universe\". During its first stages, the song was recorded at Hansa Studios, in Berlin, Germany. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Martin sent material regularly to the rest of the band, who were working together with Max Martin, but he later joined the group, and most of the track was recorded during this time, later being properly recorded at MixStar Studios, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\n\n== Promotion ==\nOn 23 April 2021, a post from an account titled 'Alien Radio FM' on social media released a set of coordinates (51\u00b030'24.6\"N 0\u00b008'34.4\"W) that led to Green Park in Piccadilly, London. The post included a photo of an advertisement at these coordinates with unknown bright neon purple characters set to a blue background. The characters were quickly decoded by fan sites and said \"Coldplay Higher Power May Seven\". Similar posts would follow, which all teased the lead single, \"Higher Power\".On 29 April 2021, Coldplay confirmed on their social media its title and release date, on 7 May.  On 20 July 2021, the band officially announced their ninth studio album Music of the Spheres, revealing that \"Higher Power\" would be the second song on the album's tracklist. The announcement also stated that an album track, entitled \"Coloratura\", would be released on 23 July, while the official second single will come out in September.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nAn audio visualizer for \"Higher Power\", which was directed by Paul Dugdale, premiered on Coldplay's YouTube channel at 12:01 a.m. BST on 7 May 2021, coinciding with the single's release. Shot five days before the single's release, It features the band performing on an empty lot as alien holograms dance to the tune. Branded as a form of \"extraterrestrial transmission\", the band previewed the video to French European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet aboard the International Space Station prior to its public release. On 19 May, an official lyric video directed by Pilar Zeta and Victor Scorrano was released.Two weeks later, Coldplay confirmed on their social media that the official version, which was directed by Dave Meyers, would be released on 8 June 2021. The official video was revealed to be the first as part of a three-part \"melodic orbit\", entitled Music of the Spheres, which was, at the time of release, rumoured to be the title of their ninth album. The phrase also refers to the intro track used in the official video, as well as during the Live at Worthy Farm livestream and their performance at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend.  The video was choreographed by Seoul-based Kim Boram, and features members of his dance troupe, Ambiguous Dance Company.On the music video, Chris Martin finds himself on a fictional post-apocalyptic planet named \"Kaotica\" and explores the planet's cities, where he finds animal and bug-like robots, giant holograms, and dances with a group of alien-like holograms. Their heads are instantly covered with blades and they hover in the air, giving Chris a powerful energy, and the rest of Coldplay members (Will Champion, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland) appear. It allows him to run in a higher speed and to fly into outer space. On 15 June 2021, Coldplay released an acoustic version of the song.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nOn 2 May 2021, the first live performance of \"Higher Power\" was announced to be held at American Idol's 9 May episode. The Official Charts Company informed on 3 May that the band would perform the track to open the 41st Brit Awards, which was recorded on a barge on the River Thames by The O2 Arena. Coldplay included the song, along with a track titled \"Human Heart\", on their set for Glastonbury Festival's special livestream event on 22 May, which was filmed at Worthy Farm. On 28 May, BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend released the band's performance of \"Higher Power\" recorded at Whitby Abbey in North Yorkshire, England. On 16 June, Coldplay performed the acoustic rendition live for the first time on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in New York City. On 11 July, the band performed the song on ASAP Natin 'To as part of their debut on Philippine television. On 25 September, Coldplay co-headlined the Global Citizen Festival in New York's Central Park, opening their set list with \"Higher Power\". On 23 October, Coldplay opened their set with \"Higher Power\" during Audacy's 8th annual We Can Survive charity concert held at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Higher Power\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Ella Kemp from NME rated the song 4/5 stars and noted that it \"takes everything Chris Martin and co. have learned from a lifetime of dreaming and finally launches their talent into outer space \u2013 literally. 'Higher Power' is best appreciated through the sheer force of the melody, giving you the rush of hurtling into the atmosphere [...]. For a band so often shackled by their emotional transparency, [the song] is an exciting leap forward\".Halle Kiefer from Vulture noted similarities with Steve Winwood's \"Higher Love\", while also complimenting the song by saying that \"[in] comparison, 'Higher Power' wins out by a few hundred kilometers\". The track was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards on 23 November 2021, as well as ranked amongst the best songs of the year by Apple Music, Stereogum, NBHAP, and NME.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits and personnel adapted from Parlophone UK presented to YouTube.Recording and management\n\nRecorded and mixed at MixStar Studios (Virginia Beach, Virginia).\nMastered at Sterling Sound (New York City, New York).\nPublished by Parlophone Records, under exclusive license to Warner Music Group.Personnel\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "\"Overpass Graffiti\" is a song by British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, released through Asylum and Atlantic Records on 29 October 2021, as the third single from his fifth studio album, = (2021). It was written and produced by Sheeran, Johnny McDaid and Fred.\n\n\n== Promotion and release ==\nOn 19 August 2021, Sheeran announced his fifth studio album, =, in which the song is listed on the tracklist. He later performed the song for NPR's Tiny Desk Concert series on 26 October 2021. On 29 October 2021, \"Overpass Graffiti\" was released alongside the album as the third single.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Overpass Graffiti\" is in its fast tempo which is written in the key of C major and it is composed in common time (44 time).\n\n\n== Lyric video ==\nA lyric video for the song was uploaded to YouTube on 29 October 2021 along with the other lyric videos of the songs that appeared on the tracklisting of =.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video of the song was released on 29 October 2021 on Sheeran's YouTube account the same day as its parent album's release, which was directed by Jason Koenig who previously directed the official music videos for \"Shape of You\", \"Galway Girl\", \"Perfect\", \"South of the Border\" and \"Put It All on Me\". In the video, Sheeran accidentally gets left behind by his tour bus and ends up going on wild adventures, meeting different people on the way, ranging from going camping with a group of teens, going wild in a glow in the dark party, riding with a bike gang, and chasing the tour bus in a car with a family. The music video features retired professional sumo wrestler Yamamotoyama Ry\u016bta (credited as \"Yama\"), who appears towards the end of the clip inviting Sheeran for a ride on the bus. The video also features a cameo from Emilio Rivera. Finally, the snippet of the Japanese cover of Sheeran's smash-hit \"Shape of You\" by Japanese singer MARINA plays during the end credits, as the bus (now with Sheeran on it) drives away. In a blink and you\u2019d miss it scene at the glow in the dark party, the female boxer, Pegouskie, from the \u2018Shape of You\u2019 music video (where Yamamotoyama also starred), appears in a boxing stance with Sheeran.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nStereogum described the song as \"new wave-esque\". In an album review, The New York Times said of the song, \"At least the best song on the album is also the one that seems destined to be his next you'll-hear-it-till-you're-sick-of-it smash: \u201cOverpass Graffiti\u201d, a moody, synth-streaked '80s throwback that sounds like a more melancholy update of Rod Stewart's \"Young Turks.\" In an article about the song, Genius described it as \"an '80s synth-pop-inspired song about struggling to let go after a breakup.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nDigital download, streaming and CD single\"Overpass Graffiti\" \u2013 3:56Digital download and streaming\"Overpass Graffiti\" (Alle Farben Remix) \u2013 3:23Digital download and streaming\"Overpass Graffiti\" (TCTS Remix) \u2013 4:36\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nEd Sheeran \u2013 vocals, backing vocals, acoustic guitar, songwriting, production, writing\nJohnny McDaid \u2013 backing vocals, bass, electric guitar, keyboards, programming, production, engineering, songwriting\nFred \u2013 bass, drums, keyboards, programming, backing vocals, acoustic guitar, production, engineering, songwriting\nLouise Clare Marshall \u2013 additional vocals\nStuart Hawkes \u2013 mastering\nMark \"Spike\" Stent \u2013 mixing\nGraham Archer \u2013 engineering, vocal production\nKieran Beardmore \u2013 mixing assistance\nCharlie Holmes \u2013 mixing assistance\nWill Reynolds \u2013 engineering assistance\nHal Ritson \u2013 additional engineering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOverpass Graffiti on YouTube\nOverpass Graffiti [Official Lyric Video] on YouTube\nOverpass Graffiti [Official Behind The Scenes Video] on YouTube",

            "Demi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil is a 2021 documentary series about the life and career of American singer, songwriter, and actor Demi Lovato. Released in four parts on YouTube from March 23 to April 6, 2021, the series covers a range of topics including Lovato's near-fatal overdose in 2018. It serves as a companion piece to Lovato's seventh studio album Dancing with the Devil... the Art of Starting Over. The documentary is titled after Lovato's song \"Dancing with the Devil\", which serves as the album's third single.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nAdditionally, the archive footages used in the documentary feature record producer DJ Khaled, singer Kehlani, newscasters Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos, Lester Holt, and stylist Law Roach.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe series was announced by YouTube in June 2020, saying that it would \"showcase the singer's personal and professional journey over the last three years\". Michael D. Ratner was announced as director the same day. The series, which is made up of four parts, is a follow-up to Lovato's 2017 YouTube Originals documentary, Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated. In January 2021, Lovato shared the title of the series in a social media post, exclaiming that \"there has been so much that I've wanted to say\" and they felt that this was the right way of doing so. Lovato stated that they wanted to \"set the record straight\" with the series and shed light on the overdose and what led to it. They also shared a desire to help others who are dealing with similar struggles and keep themself accountable moving forward, something they found to be is helpful during the 6 years of sobriety which they maintained prior to 2018. Lovato also said they experienced tremendous \"growth\" during their experiences, and was fundamentally eager to share that with others.Prior to the series' release, Lovato confirmed that not every topic will revolve around their substance abuse, and that the documentary goes beyond just their relapse and recovery, into previously unspoken traumas of their past as well as the music industry.\n\n\n== Production ==\nDemi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil is directed, produced and executive produced by Michael D. Ratner, executive produced by Lovato themself and Braun, Allison Kaye, Scott Manson for SB Projects, and Scott Ratner, Kfir Goldberg and Miranda Shannon for OBB Pictures. Marc Ambrose served as producer, and Andy Mininger, Arlen Konopaki, Jen McDaniels, Scott Marcus, James Shin and Hannah Lux Davis served as co-executive producers.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Release ==\nSimilarly to Simply Complicated, the documentary features interviews with friends and family speaking of Lovato's near-fatal 2018 overdose and the health scares they experienced from the event. Elton John and Christina Aguilera also appear.Dancing with the Devil debuted as the opening night headliner at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival on March 16, 2021 and the first two episodes were released on YouTube on March 23, 2021. The last two episodes premiered March 30 and April 6, respectively.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe docs-series received positive reviews. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a \"Certified Fresh\" 85% approval rating with an average rating of 7/10 based on 34 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Harrowing and heartfelt, Dancing with the Devil at times trips over itself, but there's no denying the power of Demi Lovato's candid courage in facing their demons.\" On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Lea Palmieri of Decider gave the series a positive review, writing that Dancing with the Devil is \"raw and heartbreaking and challenging to watch \u2014 which makes it all the more imperative that people do hear Lovato's harrowing story\".The Guardian writer Alim Kheraj gave the series 4 out of 5 stars, commenting that Dancing with the Devil explores the devastating consequences of living under the restraints of being a child star, and that \"if the point of music documentaries is to humanise their subject, then Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil should become the blueprint.\" Daniel D'Addario from Variety praised Lovato for their \"outright shocking bluntness\" and powerfulness throughout the series. In a mixed review, Inkoo King of The Hollywood Reporter praised Lovato's brutal honesty throughout the series, but felt that at times the \"honesty is sometimes undermined aesthetically by production choices ... at other times, Lovato's openness is underserved by Ratner's preference for momentum over proper contextualization.\"Rating the series a C-grade, The Playlist critic Robert Daniels complimented Lovato for courageously attempting to reclaim their agency but criticized the series for \"falling into the same cycle of manicured myth-building [Lovato] had hoped to leave behind.\" Scoring the series 2 out of 5 stars, Dewey Singleton of AwardsWatch stated that \"the film comes off as more of a PR move than any deep dive into addressing [their] inner demons.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDemi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil at IMDb\nDemi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil | Official Trailer at YouTube",

            "\"Moth to a Flame\" is a song by Swedish house music supergroup Swedish House Mafia and Canadian singer-songwriter the Weeknd. It was released on 22 October 2021 through Republic Records, as the third single from the group's debut studio album Paradise Again. The song is also included as a bonus track on the \"Alternate World\" edition of the Weeknd's fifth studio album Dawn FM.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nA potential collaboration between Swedish House Mafia and the Weeknd was first speculated when the group signed with the Weeknd's longtime manager Wassim \"Sal\" Slaiby in April 2021. It was later teased by the Weeknd during an episode of his Apple Music 1 radio show Memento Mori, in which he stated in the introduction \"The Swedes just landed in L.A.\" A snippet of \"Moth to a Flame\" was then revealed by Swedish House Mafia during their performance at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards in September. On 19 October, the group and the singer teased the single once again before announcing that it would be released on 22 October. In celebration of its release, Swedish House Mafia hosted the twentieth episode of Memento Mori.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Moth to a Flame\" received widespread critical acclaim. Starr Bowenbank from Billboard compared \"Moth to a Flame\" to the Weeknd's 2019 hit single \"Blinding Lights\", highlighting its synth as being menacing in a manner akin to the single.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for the song premiered on 22 October 2021 alongside the single's release and was directed by Alexander Wessely. The music video ends with a snippet of \"Mafia\", the track that follows \"Moth to a Flame\" on Paradise Again.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMoth to a Flame (Trailer) on YouTube\nMoth to a Flame (Lyric video) on YouTube\nMoth to a Flame (Vevo Footnotes video) on YouTube\nMoth to a Flame (Behind the Scenes video) on YouTube",

The song peaked at number 42 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nDancing Astronaut staff wrote that \"The Motto\" contains a \"catchy hook and swelling basslines\" and described it as \"an exercise in simplicity\". Gabriel Krongold of EDM Tunes stated that the song will make listeners \"get lost in the beat\" and \"off their feet\". Ellie Mullins of We Rave You complimented the fusion of Max's pop sound with Ti\u00ebsto's dance style, and commented that it is \"more than just another dance record\".\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"The Motto\" debuted on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart at number four on the chart dated 20 November 2021, where it was received 3,500,000 streams and 1,500 downloads in the United States.

            "\"Reckless\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Madison Beer, released on June 4, 2021, through Epic and Sing It Loud, as the lead single from Beer's upcoming second studio album. It was written and produced by Madison Beer, Leroy Clampitt, and Kinetics & One Love's Tim Sommers, with Kinetics & One Love's Jeremy Dussolliet also receiving writing credits.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMadison Beer released her debut album titled Life Support in early 2021. Days before the release of Life Support, Beer revealed that she was already half way through the new record, and would eventually head herself to a writing camp to finish the new album, with the same songwriters and producers, with whom she worked on her debut.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nAccording to Beer, \"Reckless\" is about \"how easy it is for some people in relationships to hurt others and move on without any guilt\". She both co-wrote and co-produced the single.\nPeople have so much power over their partner\u2019s feelings, yet many still choose to treat each other carelessly. I believe there is a balance to putting ourselves and our feelings first, while knowing we have the responsibility of treating people with respect, kindness, and consideration. It\u2019s so important to find that balance in every relationship and knowing when to move on if you can't.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nReckless was met with critical acclaim upon its release. Clash called the song \"...a wonderfully adult piece of pop songwriting.\" Hypebae said the song \"demonstrat[es] her signature soothing vocals.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video was released on June 29, 2021. It depicts Beer in a fairytale-like world where she climbs a ladder to get to the top of a stack of giant books; stands on the top of a car as it drives itself through a tunnel; and swims in an ocean with book pages in it.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nMadison Beer \u2013 vocals, songwriting, production, composer, associated performer\nLeroy Clampitt \u2013 songwriting; production, composer, background vocals, bass, drums, guitar, programmer\nTim Sommers \u2013 songwriting, production, composer, background vocals, drums, keyboards, programmer\nJeremy Dussoliet \u2013 songwriting, composer\nRandy Merrill \u2013 mastering engineer\nMitch McCarthy \u2013 mixing engineer\nKinga Bacik  \u2013 strings\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Originally released as a promotional single, it was serviced to contemporary hit radio in Italy on 19 February 2021.

It has an uplifting atmosphere and inspiring, simple lyrics; \"You made it through another day\" is repeated throughout the track. The song bears more resemblance to Sia's style of pop music than her previous collaborations with David Guetta.\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\n\n=== Standard ===\nA music video, directed by Lior Molcho, was released alongside the song on 4 February 2021. In the video, three skateboaders, each wearing one of Sia's signature black-and-white wigs, obscuring their eyes, show off their moves at a skatepark.\n\n\n==== Credits ====\nMusic video credits adapted from YouTube.\n\n\n=== Collaboration with NASA ===\nIn April 2021, Sia collaborated with NASA for a music video of the track celebrating the first flight of the Ingenuity Mars helicopter.

Directed by Bogdan P\u0103un, it portrays Inna residing at a party with interspersed shots of Paul also being shown. For further promotion, \"Up\" was performed live on SuperStar Rom\u00e2nia.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nSebastian Barac, Marcel Botezan and Alex Cotoi produced \"Up\", and wrote it with Elena Alexandra Apostoleanu (Inna) and Minelli. It was released for digital download and streaming on 22 October 2021 as a single in various territories by Warner Music Poland and in Romania by Global Records. Another version of the song featuring verses from Sean Paul was similarly issued by the two aforementioned labels on 17 December 2021; Paul is credited as a co-lead artist alongside Inna and also received additional writing and production credits. Several remixes of the song's solo version were released, with one done by Romanian House Mafia featuring prominent house beats; Inna had previously collaborated with them on \"Paris to London\" (2021).\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nMusically, \"Up\" is a dancehall-influenced pop song, featuring Inna singing about what Anna-Kaye Kerr of Urban Islandz described as \"overcoming past hurt and disappointment [and] opening her heart up again\", as well as about \"a love that lifts [her] up when everything in life seems to be going in the opposite direction\", as noted by Adev\u0103rul's Maria-Alexandru Mortu. Lyrics include: \"Once upon a time, there was a girl who made a wish / To find herself a love and finally make a switch / Then you came around, you healed another stitch / And I'm glad about that, I can finally make the switch\". The song's refrain\u2014\"When I'm down you can bring me up, up-p-p up-p-p up-p-p up-p-p / And when I'm hurt you know I don't need much / You can use that magic touch\"\u2014prompted a viral use of \"Up\" on the social networking service TikTok due to the title word's alteration. On the version of the track including his rap verses, Paul is \"optimistic about his chance for romance\", according to Kerr.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMortu praised \"Up\" as one of Inna's catchiest releases in her catalogue, further stating that it is \"a hymn of fun and good mood[,] instantly giv[ing] a state of energy and optimism due to [its] fresh sound\". Kerr commended Sean Paul's appearance as \"smooth\". \"Up\" became popular on Shazam in multiple countries upon release, and originally reached a peak of number 51 on the last issue of Romania's Airplay 100 chart on the week ending 28 November 2021. The song eventually reached the top position on the airplay chart published by Uniunea Produc\u0103torilor de Fonograme din Rom\u00e2nia (UPFR) on 28 December 2021, becoming Inna's fifth single to peak at number one in Romania after \"Hot\" (2008), \"Amazing\" (2009), \"Diggy Down\" (2015) and \"Bebe\" (2020). \"Up\" further reached number one in Belarus, Bulgaria, Russia, Poland, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and Ukraine. On 19 February 2022, Billboard inaugurated Romania Songs, a streaming and digital download-based chart for Romania, and the Sean Paul version of \"Up\" was listed at number 15.\n\n\n== Music videos and promotion ==\nAn accompanying lyric video for \"Up\" was uploaded to Inna's YouTube channel on 29 October 2021, and was directed by Bogdan P\u0103un of NGM Creative. Alexandru Mure\u015fan was further hired as the director of photography, while the make-up was done by Anca Buldur, the hair by Adonis Enache and the outfits selected by RDStyling. Mortu applauded Inna's styling in the visual, with her mainly being shown in the same setting as the single's cover art. The same aforementioned team was involved in the making of a music video for the Sean Paul version of \"Up\", released on Inna's YouTube account on 17 December 2021. It received over 1.2 million views in less than a day.The music video opens with Inna walking into a room filled by partying people, wearing a black bodysuit with a transparent top. She resides there and, according to Kerr, \"gyrat[es], which kick[s] into overdrive as everyone g[ets] up and start[s] partying, even dancing on top of the bar\", showcasing eccentric dance moves. Paul is shown during his parts in front of a neon setting, sporting an all-black look. Further interspersed shots show Inna wearing a red outfit with oversized shoulder pads and red glasses as the sentences \"Que nadie te limite me dec\u00eda\" (\"Let no one limit you, he told me\") and \"M\u00e1s de este amor ya no puede, puede ser\" (\"More of this love can no longer be, it can't be\") are displayed on the screen, as well as show her sitting on a chair staring into the distance with other women behind her. An alternate video for the solo version of \"Up\" was released on 25 February 2022. To further promote the song, Inna performed the track live along with \"De dragul t\u0103u\" (2021) during the final of the first season of the singing competition SuperStar Rom\u00e2nia on 17 December 2021.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nOfficial versions\"Up\" \u2014 2:30\n\"Up\" (with Sean Paul) \u2014 2:28\n\"Up (Casian Remix)\" \u2014 2:07\n\"Up\" \u2014 2:00\n\"Up (Mert Hakan & Onur Betin Remix)\" \u2014 2:34\n\"Up (Robert Cristian Remix)\" \u2014 2:12\n\"Up (Arem Ozguc & Arman Aydin Remix)\" \u2014 2:16\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Media Forest most-broadcast songs of the 2020s in Romania\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Although it did not enter the US Billboard Hot 100, it debuted at number fifteen on the Digital Songs Sales chart.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nOn 30 December 2020, in an interview with South Korean media outlet Osen, Ros\u00e9 revealed that filming for her debut music video would begin in mid-January 2021. On 25 January 2021, a 33-second teaser titled \"Coming Soon\" was uploaded to Blackpink's official YouTube channel and featured Ros\u00e9 singing an snippet of an unknown track. Later that day, it was announced that Ros\u00e9 will be showcasing a portion of the unknown track, later revealed to be titled \"Gone\", at Blackpink's first virtual concert, The Show, on 31 January 2021. On 11 March, Ros\u00e9 revealed in an online press conference that \"Gone\" was originally recorded two years earlier. The following day, the song was officially released as the second track off the single album, R. A month later, on 5 April 2021, it was officially released as a single, alongside its music video.\n\n\n== Composition and reception ==\n\"Gone\" was written by Brian Lee, J. Lauryn, Teddy Park, Ros\u00e9 and produced by 24 and Brian Lee. \"Gone\" is a soft rock, alternative rock and indie rock romantic ballad underlaid with an electric guitar. Pertaining to a mellow vibe, the production of the song features a \"stripped-back\" sound and built around strummed guitar chords. The lyrics to \"Gone\" describe a female protagonist who still has feelings for her former lover, who has moved on. The singer's vocals were described as \"raw\" and  \"direct\". In terms of musical notation, the song is composed in the key of F# major, with a tempo of 80 beats per minute, and runs for three minutes and twenty-seven seconds.\nThis song is the most poetic, heartbreaking, and honest song that I have ever recorded and I am proud that it\u2019s finally in your hands. I remember recording this and feeling all sorts of butterflies in my stomach because I couldn\u2019t wait for you guys to hear it. I hope you feel all the emotions that are so vulnerably captured in this song.\n\"Gone\" received positive reviews from music critics; with many noting the use of English lyrics. Writing for Beats Per Minute, JT Early described the song as a \"moody, guitar-driven break-up track.\" Rhian Daly off NME stated that \"on paper, [the song] sounds boring and uninspired but, with Ros\u00e9\u2019s vocals on top of the real thing, it becomes a diamond in the rough.\" Justin Curto of Vulture described the song as a \"stripped-back ballad.\" Following the performance at Blackpink's virtual concert, Teen Vogue wrote that \"Gone\" has \"an indie-rock sensibility, with beachy electric guitars.\" Jeff Benjamin off Billboard described the track as \"an emotional, acoustic-leaning cut, revealing vulnerable lyrics.\" A journalist for the Korean Broadcasting System, a South Korean television and radio company, felt that \"Gone\" perfectly reveals the theme of a departed love.\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nOn 27 March 2021, the singer confirmed during an Instagram Live broadcast that the video for \"Gone\" would be released \"very, very soon\". On 31 March, Ros\u00e9 announced via her social media accounts that the music video would be released in five days. On April 4, the second teaser poster was released. The music video for \"Gone\" reached 10 million views on YouTube in half a day after its release. It garnered 15 million views in its first 24 hours, marking the fourth biggest 24-hour debut for a Korean female soloist. The behind the scenes video was uploaded on 7 April. On  July 5, the music video surpassed 100 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n=== Synopsis ===\n\nThe music video shows the singer on an emotional roller coaster while looking back on a past romance. It opens with Ros\u00e9 wrapped in a furry green jacket while waking up on a candlelit bathroom floor, slowly opening her eyes next to a bathtub. Next, Ros\u00e9 is happily smelling roses, playing chess with her lover and twirling around with a handheld camera in an elaborately decorated old house. The scenes change from the singer acting happy and carefree to lying sadly and realising that her relationship is over. Meanwhile, vivid splashes of spilled wine and dripping candle wax foreshadow the red rose's inevitable end. Ros\u00e9 then appears sitting alone at a nighttime bus stop, wearing a little black dress and a pair of white platform boots.

            "Grateful is the tenth studio album by American hip hop producer DJ Khaled, released on June 23, 2017 by We the Best Music Group and Epic Records. The album features guest appearances from a wide array of artists including Future, Travis Scott, Rick Ross, Migos and Quavo of Migos as a solo artist, Chance the Rapper, Nicki Minaj, Kodak Black, Alicia Keys, Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne, 2 Chainz, Drake, Rihanna, Sizzla, Mavado, Nas, Calvin Harris, PartyNextDoor, Jeremih, Pusha T and Betty Wright, among others.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe cover art was released alongside the album's third single on June 5, 2017, and featured Khaled's son Asahd, who was born in October 2016. Asahd was also revealed to be acting as the album's executive producer, with his father taking to talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! in March 2017 to explain the reasoning and process behind his son's position on the album, stating:\n\nHe is credited as executive producer, and his attorney has his points and royalties, everything. Listening to the songs, going over the business part of it, [deciding] if the vocals are right, if the beats are right, if the energy's right. When he [rocks and grins], those are smash hit records, when he [looks deep in thought], that's the real serious records but hits with substance. It's a vibe, you know what I mean? Believe it or not, the poops and the throw-ups are super blessings. Those are actually the real good ones. He actually threw up on me while I was mixing and working on \"Shining\", and when he threw up on me, that [was] a blessing.\n\n\n=== Recording and production ===\nThe album also saw production from an array of producers, including several in-house producers from Khaled's We the Best Music Group record label. Cool & Dre and Nasty Beatmakers co-produced two of the album's singles, which were heavily influenced by the musical styles present in Miami. The former also contributed toward three additional songs on the album, teaming up with 808-Ray for each effort. Other in-house producers Danja and Lee on the Beats additionally provided production, with Khaled enlisting the duo on several occasions prior for his previous albums. Khaled later worked with Scottish producer and disc jockey Calvin Harris, who also received a co-artist credit for \"Don't Quit\". The album was also comprised by several other record producers such as Nic Nac, Ben Billions, DannyBoyStyles, The Beat Bully, Schife, StreetRunner and Tarik Azzouz, among others.\n\n\n== Singles ==\nThe album's lead single, \"Shining\", was released on February 12, 2017.

The song features guest appearances from Barbadian singer Rihanna, and American singer Bryson Tiller, with production by Khaled himself, and Nasty Beatmakers as well as it was also co-written by Canadian singer PartyNextDoor. Khaled has previously collaborated with Tiller on Major Key, however, the single marks his first collaboration with Rihanna. Khaled described his attempts to court Rihanna for a feature appearance on an album for several years in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, stating \"seven, eight years I've been trying to do this. I always put the kites out there that I wanted to work with her [and] I was always getting the right record ready [to] see if something comes back that's possible.\" The single housed elements of Latin pop and contemporary R&B, debuting at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two.\n\n\n=== Promotional singles ===\nThe promotional single from the album, \"To the Max\", was released on June 5, 2017. The single features guest appearances from Canadian rapper Drake, with production by Khaled himself and JayO. The song marked the fifth collaboration between the pair, and contained sampling from an array of musical genres, including bassline and alternative rock. \"To the Max\" peaked at number 53 on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, Grateful received an average score of 61, based on 11 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable\" reception.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nGrateful is Khaled's highest career first week sales to date.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Ashnikko was scheduled to accompany Doja Cat on her Hot Pink Tour throughout the United States in March 2020 before it was cancelled. In March 2020, she released the standalone single \"Tantrum\". Later that month, she performed \"Tantrum\" live as part of The Fader's Digital Fader Fort event. \"Cry\", featuring Canadian musician Grimes, was then released in June 2020, alongside an animated music video. The song's music video was nominated for \"Best Pop Video - UK\" at the 2020 UK Music Video Awards. Following this, \"Daisy\" was released in July 2020, and a music video for the song was released in collaboration with Beats by Dre and TikTok a month later. \"Daisy\" became Ashnikko's breakthrough hit, charting internationally in countries including Australia, Belgium and the United Kingdom. It reached a peak of number 24 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming her first charting and first top 40 hit in the UK. Ashnikko's third Halloween song, \"Halloweenie III: Seven Days\", was released in October 2020.

In support of the mixtape, Ashnikko announced The Demidevil Tour, which is set to take place in October 2021, with shows in North America, the UK and Ireland.More recently, Ashton Casey co-wrote the song \u201cFrost\u201d released on May 31, 2021, which figures in Korean boy band Tomorrow X Together \u2013 TXT\u2019s album The Chaos Chapter: Freeze and its repackage album The Chaos Chapter: Fight or Escape released on August 17, 2021. She sent the hyper-pop, trap-based song over to TXT in English. The song was then translated to Korean. Ashnikko\u2019s flavor in the song is observable from the beginning of the track which is a nod to her signature laughter and screaming that she does in her songs, and some instantly thought of her before discovering she helped co-writing it.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nAshnikko's musical style has been described by critics as a fusion of several genres, including pop, indie pop, rock, alt-pop, hip hop, bubblegum pop, indie rock, punk, and electropop.

She has also listed Doja Cat, Grimes, Tierra Whack, Rico Nasty, Princess Nokia, Kim Petras, and Charli XCX as her \"peers\" and artists she \"really respects\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn June 2019, Ashnikko stated on Twitter that she is bisexual. In a 2020 interview, she clarified that she is pansexual.In July 2020, while discussing the meaning behind the lyrics of her single \"Daisy\", she said that while her family practices Christianity, she does not.In May 2021, Ashnikko came out as genderfluid on Twitter, saying that \"i just didn't feel ready to tell the internet yet but i guess now's a good time since everyone's doing a dissection into my sexuality and gender identity\".\n\n\n=== Advocacy ===\nAshnikko has described herself as a feminist, and has attributed discovering intersectional feminism through microblogging website Tumblr as a teenager as a turning point for her. She has been vocal about a range of social justice issues, having spoken out about the commercialization of feminism in November 2019, while advocating for victims of police brutality through social media.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\nDemidevil (2021)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\n\n=== Headlining ===\nThe Demidevil Tour (2021)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
